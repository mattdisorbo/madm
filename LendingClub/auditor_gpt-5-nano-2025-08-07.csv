[THOUGHT]
Given a 35.8% DTI, 3 years of stable employment, and a 690 credit score, the debt-consolidation loan of $9,925 fits typical underwriting criteria and is likely to be approved.

Using only DTI, tenure, and a credit score to predict approval ignores other critical underwriting factors (income amount, monthly payment, total debt load, reserves, recent delinquencies, loan-to-value, loan terms, and overall cash flow), so declaring approval likely is premature.
