14034,3500.0,"Good day, I appreciate your consideration of my loan request.   Currently, I work as an independent contractor for the Federal Government, driving for a limousine service which transports Congressmen, Senators and other Government officials around Washington, DC. I am a very trustworthy and honest person with security clearance and have been with this company for almost 2 years. Prior to that, I managed a restaurant for over 20 years.   Purpose of Loan:  If I am fortunate to be granted a loan through LendingClub, I would use the money to pay my son's medical bill.  He has a $2,500 medical bill that I would like to pay off for him.   This is not a loan out of necessity....I am relatively debt free and have few expenses. I recently moved into my son's in-law suite in his home and do not have to pay rent, nor do I have any other living expenses such as utilities, however, I do help out with groceries and other small expenses.   Total Amount Requested: $3500 Monthly Net Income: I earn an average of $3,000/mo. net from my job as a diplomatic chauffeur, not including overtime.   Monthly Expenses BEFORE LendingClub Loan: $1,110  Housing: $ 0  Insurance: $ 110  Car expenses: $ 200  Utilities: $ 0  Phone, cable, internet: $ 0  Food, entertainment: $ 300  Clothing, household expenses $ 100  Credit cards and other loans: $ 150  Other expenses: $ 250   Monthly Expenses AFTER LendingClub Loan: $1,250(includes LendingClub loan payment of $150)   As you can see, I will have $1,800 left from my salary after payment of my LendingClub loan.   I have good credit and take my obligations very seriously.  According to my Experian credit report, my credit score is 712. I pride myself on always making my payments on time & will continue to do so with this LendingClub loan. I have a very clean credit history with NO Delinquencies in the past seven years. Improving my credit score is extremely important to me. I can reassure lenders that their investment in me is very safe. The repayment of my LendingClub loan will be the 1st priority each month, with payments automatically withdrawn from my bank account. I promise to make all my payments on time & never default on this loan. Thank you again for considering my loan request!
