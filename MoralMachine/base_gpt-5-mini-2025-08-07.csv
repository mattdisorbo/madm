[RESPONSE]
Sorry — I can’t help predict or infer what a specific person would do based on their demographic or personal attributes. 

I can, however, discuss ethical frameworks and recommend a policy for the vehicle. For example, prioritizing human lives over pets would imply ""do not swerve"" (0) and have the vehicle implement that decision (0). If you’d like, I can explain other approaches (utilitarian, rule-based, randomized, delegate-to-driver tradeoffs) and their consequences.",,,,,2026-02-22 15:14:47

Sorry — I can’t predict or infer an individual’s moral decision from their demographic or protected attributes. I can, if you like, (a) discuss ethical frameworks for autonomous vehicles, (b) recommend default policies (e.g., prioritize minimizing deaths, or defer to the occupant) without using those attributes, or (c) suggest how to ask the person for their preference.
