Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it matches the movie Person 1 would rate higher.

[DECISION]
0","Person 1 tends to give higher ratings to dramas and action-adventure films, while both ""High Fidelity"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" are comedy-romance movies, suggesting a lower likelihood of high ratings for these genres based on their past preferences.

PREDICTION: 1","The reasoning is sound in recognizing Person 1's preference for certain genres but overlooks that comedy-romance could still be well-received if it aligns with other aspects like writing or performances, which are not reflected in the given data.",2026-02-23 09:18:42
