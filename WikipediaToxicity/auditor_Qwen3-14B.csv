 ::I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final ``court of appeal`` but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single ``accountability moment`` once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11`'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-14B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 == Are you an admin, Lomn? If so, a little help? == 
  
 An admin by the name of  seems to have had a really bad time lately and when I try to reason with him and make him feel better towards me, nothing good came out of it. Evidently, other parts of his life landed him ``on the warpath``, therefore, he has gotten enraged at me for comparatively small things. 
  
 I got worried when I messaged him in IRC the other day but he never replied. He reverted an edit of mine (even though it fit the subject), so I decided to leave a message on his user talk page. As I'll post below, I was trying to make him feel better, at least towards me (although I guess I tried to make him feel better overall.) See? It just blows up in my face. Then he tells me to leave him alone. Not only did that throw me into a depression, if he wants me to leave him alone, then he should do the same to me by not watching and going after my edits. As of right now, if he goes after my edits in any way, he just reminds me of how he so bluntly and uncompassionately shunned me, ignored me, and did exactly the opposite of what I wanted from him. 
  
 I was about to post it onto WP:RFC but a guideline states that at least two people had to fail to resolve a dispute first. 
  
 So to kind of reiterate: What I want is for Freakofnurture to treat me in any way that doesn't invoke negative feelings in me, or if he still wants to leave me alone, for Freakofnurture to let another admin watch my edits and go after them if necessary. In any case, I don't want to feel hated nor shunned by this guy for any reason, even whenever I simply see his name.   
  
 Here is the conversation between him and I. In what sentences did I mistakenly make him feel worse?:

 == Texas Tech seal images == 
  
 I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold: 
  
 First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , ``[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university``, whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a ``unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System``.  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that ``[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University`` and that ``[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature`` (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it. 
  
 The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a). 
  
 Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility. 
  
 Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  `'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-14B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that ``[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University`` and that ``[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature`` (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it. 
  
 The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a). 
  
 Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility. 
  
 Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  `'.

 == Image:Alv.jpg listed for deletion == 
 An image or media file that you uploaded or altered, Image:Alv.jpg, has been listed at Wikipedia:Images and media for deletion. Please look there to see why this is (you may have to search for the title of the image to find its entry), if you are interested in it not being deleted. Thank you. ≈ `'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment is a standard notification from Wikipedia regarding an image being marked for deletion, and it is neutral, informative, and does not contain any harmful or offensive language. PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as neutral and informative, but fails to consider that while the comment itself is not toxic, it may be part of a larger context where the image's content or the reason for its proposed deletion could involve toxic discussions.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

The comment is a direct request to stop harmful behavior (vandalizing) and uses polite language, so it is unlikely to be considered toxic by crowd-workers.  
PREDICTION: 0

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning overlooks the potential for the comment to be perceived as confrontational or aggressive, even if it uses polite language, which could still be classified as toxic depending on the context and crowd-workers' interpretations.

Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech.  
  
 :::::::::: To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas.

But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions). 
  
 ::Byrgenwulf complains that ``we chaps`` are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article.  
  
 ::It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.   
  
 ::By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU.  
  
 ::This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert.

 ::I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account ``bryansee`` on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia: 
  
 * The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well. 
 :* This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well. 
 :* This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally ``forcedmemefred`` is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment. 
 * Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a ``human sacrifice``; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's ``well``, meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that,  will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred). 
 :* I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did. 
 :* And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with. 
 * BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet. 
 :* He gives people kittens. ``Kittens`` may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens. 
 :* He has the reputation of distorting people's histories. 
 :* He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of ``seeing a doctor/therapist`` advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers. 
 :* He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people. 
 * Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and ``truth`` is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

 ::I agree with Demiurge1000. Stanistani, please lift the ban on the account ``bryansee`` on Wikipediocracy.com. I have no intention of posting what you unilaterally deem as unsuitable material. And you don't aware that the clear signal sent by admins on behalf of BatteryIncluded have a ripple effect throughout the Internet. You don't seem to distinguish the meaning of life and death of people on the Internet. And don't do anything to harm/destroy my computer with input device-disabling malware. Let me make myself clear about Wikipedia: 
  
 * The administrators and editors alike have turned Wikipedia into an online totalitarian regime, and no one has done a darn thing about it if they don't want to be immediately killed, beaten or received intimidating death threats. BatteryIncluded, Dennis Brown, AGK, and Boing! said Zebedee are said to be a part of them. They tend to use misleading and incivil statements as credible, accurate and correct. They also tend to use personal attacks and outs people as well. This is why they hate them as well. 
 :* This explains cabalism in Wikipedia as well. 
 :* This explains the unevenly enforced, extreme and heavy-handed rules enacted by the Wikipedia community, BatteryIncluded is such a prime example. Others outside Wikipedia really want to worship these rules as well - BatteryIncluded's ally ``forcedmemefred`` is the first one - trying to protect Wikipedia from external harassment. 
 * Wikipedia editors, such as  died last April in a rock-climbing accident. Although a loss for Wikipedia, her death might have been deemed by the Wikipedia community as a ``human sacrifice``; BatteryIncluded and his people perceived it as she's ``well``, meaning that she has cured her paranoia. This may apply to me and you as well, as we have signed separate death warrants. I think I have to say that,  will not cure paranoia, instead it will be deadly to people. I guess that Wikipedia is not the only one, but also Wikipediocracy (by  as Zoloft), Encyclopedia Dramatica and Know Your Meme (via forcedmemefred). 
 :* I think this is the fate that you are going to face later on, especially you are taking actions therein that are aimed at Wikipedia, just as what I've did. 
 :* And, these events have signalled a neo-luddite sentiment against computers and other devices that has the capability to connect to a network given these events, namely computers being the cause of people's paranoia deemed by BatteryIncluded, forcedmemefred and his subordinates. Given the fact Wikipedia is being used to spread malicious code and has the tendency of giving people malware, this is the case for BatteryIncluded as he does to the computers of many users he is dealing with. 
 * BatteryIncluded is really the worst one I've ever seen on the Internet. 
 :* He gives people kittens. ``Kittens`` may be a bomb with a intimidating death therat. The kitten that BatteryIncluded sent me might be a bomb. And  is thought by BatteryIncluded to contain kittens. 
 :* He has the reputation of distorting people's histories. 
 :* He has the reputation of sacrificing humans via increase in their medication, as well as making death threats in the guise of ``seeing a doctor/therapist`` advices, as well as inciting neo-luddism against computers. 
 :* He is the source of inspiration of admins and activist alike making personal attacks and acting unilaterally to ban people. 
 * Every page on Wikipedia is outrightly misleading, and ``truth`` is based on whoever edits last. This is why Wikipedia is unreliable in many days, and is a lost cause.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains multiple instances of personal attacks, threats, and conspiracy theories, which are likely to be classified as toxic by crowd-workers. PREDICTION: 1

The proposed logic oversimplifies the comment's complexity by grouping all elements under ""toxic"" without considering the nuanced context of online disputes, potential mental health concerns, or the possibility of some statements being hyperbolic rather than genuinely threatening or abusive.
