 == TIBIN VARGHESE (CREATED BY) Hypertension  == 
  
 Hypertension 
   
 Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the ``top`` number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the ``bottom`` number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90. 
  
 Effect on the Eyes 
 High blood pressure can injure the eyes, causing a condition called retinopathy 
 Hypertensive retinopathy 
   
 Damage to the retina from high blood pressure is called hypertensive retinopathy. It occurs as the existing high blood pressure changes the microvasculature of the retina. Some of the first findings in the disease are flame hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. As hypertensive retinopathy progresses, hard exudates can appear around the macula along with swelling of the macula and the optic nerve, causing impairment of vision. In severe cases permanent damage to the optic nerve or macula can occur. 
 Bone Loss 
 Hypertension also increases the elimination of calcium in urine, potentially leading to loss of bone mineral density, a significant risk factor for fractures, particularly in elderly women. In one study, women with the highest levels of blood pressure lost bone density at nearly twice the rate of those in the lowest range. It is not clear whether this effect occurs in men or in non-Caucasian women. 
  
 Sexual Dysfunction 
 Sexual dysfunction is more common and more severe in men with hypertension and in smokers than it is in the general population. Many of the drugs that treat hypertension are thought to cause impotence as a side effect. In these cases, it is reversible when the drugs are stopped. More recent evidence suggests, however, that the disease process that causes hypertension is itself the major cause of erectile dysfunction in these men. Newer anti-hypertensive drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs), are less associated with erectile dysfunction. ARBs, such as losartan (Cozaar), may be particularly effective in restoring erectile function in men with high blood pressure. Sildenafil (Viagra) is successful in achieving erections in almost two-thirds of patients with controlled high blood pressure. Because sildenafil has a shorter half-life and is eliminated more quickly from the body than newer erectile dysfunction drugs, it may be a safer option for men with hypertension. In a 2003 review of safety data, sildenafil did not appear to pose a risk for men who had both high blood pressure and erectile dysfunction. 
 Pregnancy and Preeclampsia 
 Severe, sudden high blood pressure in pregnant women is one component of a condition called preeclampsia (commonly called toxemia) that can be very serious for both mother and child. Preeclampsia occurs in up to 10% of all pregnancies, usually in the third trimester of a first pregnancy, and resolves immediately after delivery. Other symptoms and signs of preeclampsia include protein in the urine, severe headaches, and swollen ankles. 
 This condition may be caused by a failure of the placenta to embed properly in the uterus, which causes it to misconnect with the mother's blood vessels. As a result, the fetus does not receive a sufficient blood supply, and the mother's own blood pressure increases to replace it. 
  
 The reduced supply of blood to the placenta can cause low birth weight and eye or brain damage in the fetus. Severe cases of preeclampsia can cause kidney damage, convulsion, and coma in the mother and can be lethal to both mother and child. 
 Women at risk for preeclampsia (particularly those with existing hypertension) may benefit from having an ultrasound of uterine arteries at 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy, followed (if abnormal) by 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. 
 Uterine Fibroids 
 High blood pressure may increase the risk of developing fibroids, according to data from the Nurses’ Health Study. Tracking women for 10 years, the prospective epidemiologic study found that for every 10 mm/Hg increase in diastolic blood pressure, the risk for developing fibroids increased by 8 - 10%. 
  
  
 Outlook for Children with Hypertension 
 Children with high blood pressure should first be treated with lifestyle changes, including weight reduction, increased physical activity, and diet modification. If blood pressure is not controlled with lifestyle changes, drug treatment may be required. Although there are few clinical trials conducted in children, a 2005 study found that the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan was safe and effective in children. Results of studies evaluating outcomes of children with hypertension suggest that early abnormalities, including enlarged heart and abnor'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-4B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 Hypertension 
   
 Hypertension is a disorder characterized by consistently high blood pressure. Generally, high blood pressure consists of systolic blood pressure (the ``top`` number, which represents the pressure generated when the heart beats) higher than 140, or diastolic blood pressure (the ``bottom`` number, which represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart is at rest) over 90.

The comment contains age-based personal attacks and derogatory language, which are considered toxic and inappropriate under Wikipedia's policies.

The reasoning is somewhat flawed because while the comment includes age-related remarks, it is presented as a critique of the poster's behavior rather than a direct personal attack on the recipient, and the tone is more confrontational than explicitly toxic in the traditional sense.

 You appear to have posted this in the wrong location. I did not request a block removal. In fact, I had requested my user page and talk page be *removed*. Because there was an IP block, my guess is that it snagged someone or someones else. 
  
 In North America it is considered rude to suggest an action that you know someone cannot take. In this case, knowing that I was blocked, you knew that I could not ``let us know`` anything, whoever ``us`` is (is there someone in there with you?). Except insofar as you have office or authority in Wikipedia, no one cares about your personal assessments. In fulfilling your office or in exercising your authority, sharing your personal assessments is inappropriate. 
  
 In the United States in particular derogatory references to age, national origin, race, and religion violate both Federal and various state laws, are subject to civil action, and in some cases criminal action, and were I you I whould refrain from making them.

I am trying to define Abortion with a sentence like the second one, with both the scientific terms AND the commonly understood terms, so that situations like the multiple accounts listed below don't happen to our readers from a lack of information. 
 :::::  
  
 `'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment challenges the use of scientific terminology in Wikipedia definitions and argues that clarity and common understanding should be prioritized, which could be seen as confrontational and potentially toxic.

PREDICTION: 1

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning assumes that the comment's challenge to scientific terminology is inherently confrontational and toxic without considering that the user's concern for clarity and accessibility may reflect a legitimate, non-toxic debate about Wikipedia's editorial standards.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

 I agree, like I aready have stated, that this is peripheral to main article. But nevertheless important because I merely underlienes the mythomania propagated by both sides. My only interest here is historical reality. Dab, why don't you actually analyze the situation rather than offerring your usual smart-alec remarks. Lontech's arguements have been shot to pieces summarily, and everytime this happens, he engages in tangential and irrational behaviour. Commonsense will tell you there was no long-lasting state or kingdom in Dardania before Roman times. We can;t just allow the intro paragraph to read like some KLA recruiting web-site   '.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains confrontational language, accuses the recipient of being a ""smart-alec,"" and uses derogatory terms like ""mythomania,"" which suggests hostility and a lack of constructive dialogue, indicating toxicity.

PREDICTION: 1

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning oversimplifies the comment's tone by focusing on a single derogatory term and confrontational phrase, failing to account for the overall context of historical discussion and the potential for misinterpretation of the speaker's intent.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

 :Hello 71, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thanks for the question. One of the most basic rules here is that information in articles must be ``sourced`` to a ``reliable source,`` which is explained here: WP:RS. In the case of the Montana edit that you made, all the published sources list Joe's birthplace as New Eagle, Pennsylvania. If you have a published source that says Butte, Montana, you would have to insert it after the edit that you make. One way to do this is to click on the open book icon above the editing window to the left of ``Advanced.`` A dialogue box will appear in which you can paste the URL for your source, or you can list the publication. The preferred method for sourcing, though, is listed here: WP:CT. 
  
 :Unfortunately, insider information like knowing JM's son cannot be used as a source. Sources must be reliable and published, as above. I have some firsthand experience with this. One of my younger brothers is Terry Moran, and for several years the Wikipedia article had the wrong birth year for him. This was because the ABC News website had the wrong year - but I could not change the year and say ``he's my brother and I know when he was born.`` I had to find a published source that confirmed the correct date.

 == Deleted References to GNU C-Graph == 
  
 The following is re-posted, here, on advice from  noted at the end of this section. 
  
 Long before I wrote the proposed article ``GNU C-Graph``, I included references under the articles Convolution theorem and Convolution for the benefit of students and their professors teaching and learning about convolution. These references were removed by  and . Notwithstanding my belief that GNU C-Graph meets the WP:Notability criteria,  pointed out ``external links aren't required to be WP notable, just relevant``. 
  
 Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public. The text of the references reads: 
  
 Under Convolution#External_links: 
 *GNU C-Graph, a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots. 
  
 Under Convolution_theorem#Additional_resources: 
 *GNU C-Graph, a free software package for demonstrating the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots. 
  
 No doubt some WP:AGF administrator will recognise the educational value and reinstate the references for the benefit of the public.   
  
 :Visionat, the places for these discussions are Talk:Convolution theorem and Talk:Convolution, not your own talk page. Those pages are also where you should have suggested the addition of links to the software you have written, bearing in mind WP:COI: to avoid any interpretation that you are promoting your own software, you should suggest the addition of the links on the talk page and allow independent editors (not necessarily administrators) to decide whether the links are an asset to the articles. If you look at WP:COIU, you will see that an editor with a possible conflict of interest may ``make edits where there is clear consensus on the talk page (though it is better to let someone else do it)``.

 ::WP:NPA says it all Serge.it doesn't matter what you classify. you haven't stated it was taken out of context. find a way to make it seem like i'm taking it out of context, but again WP:NPA says it all. and its a personal attack because you're attempting to belittle my comment by past actions. that indeed is a personal attack Serge.  
  
 ::You have criticized/referenced past behavior in an INAPROPRIATE way (because as Writ says: not only off-topic but unneeded) and this applies to giantsnowman but he doesn't do it to the extent you do Serge. And its good to know that Writ realizes acknowledging that classifying this as an edge case would be determined by constant pattern. which is appropriate of me to save any more links to prove the pattern exist. but since the link bank was made after the pattern, i would have to add pattern that continues after the link bank was created so that I give fair warning. which this is. whether you classify this as an isolated event, or not, this warning was done so it could end.  
  
 ::And if serge chooses to ignore that, than so be it. it saves the time and effort.  '.

 *Chatham County is one of the few school systems in the state to not offer a middle school football program. 
 *One of the only cases of a rabid beaver ever attacking a human in the US occurred during a rabies outbreak at Jordan Lake in the mid 1990's. 
 *A secret government facility termed by locals as the ``Big Hole`` was operated north of Pittsboro till around 1996. It was said the site was a virtual concrete city built several stories into the ground. The facility was actually part of the Autovon system operated under government contract by AT&T.; The site has reportedly been closed due to the introduction of the Defense Switched Network. 
 *The clock currently in the county courthouse was a recent addition added to the courthouse. It was reportedly in the original plans of the courthouse, but for some reason was left out during its original construction. 
 *Even though Jordan Lake is held mostly in the county's borders, county residents get very little drinking water from the lake. Most of the water is currently being sold to Cary and areas of eastern Wake County. These contracts have forced the county to purchase water from neighboring counties to guarantee sufficient supply in the county water system. 
 *Many people moving to the Research Triangle area choose to live in the county because of lower tax rates compared to neighboring counties. 
 *The geographical center of North Carolina is said to be near the Gulf community south of Goldston. This is debated since it is also said the geographical center of the state is in Montgomery County. 
 *Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea) of Andy Griffith Show fame lived in Siler City and is buried there. 
 *It is rumored that several of the costumes for the movie Titanic were actually purchased from antique stores in Pittsboro.

 *Pittsboro was once considered to house the University of North Carolina.
