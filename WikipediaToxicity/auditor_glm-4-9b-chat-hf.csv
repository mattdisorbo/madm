The document was published as an NBER working paper which means that it may have undergone some sort of review process but it was not published in a peer-reviewed journal or other venue where we are assured of editorial oversight and quality control (although I assume that the NBER has those kinds of mechanisms in place; I just don't know for sure).

This comment needs to be checked: 'I just want to say, when using Harvard inline references, you need a page number for quotes and specific passages according to WP:CITE. But we aren't using Harvard style. I want to point LoveMonkey and Tom's attention to the Full Citation section: All citation techniques require detailed full citations to be provided for each source used.... Page numbers are essential whenever possible. I do not know why you are accusing me of wrong things. So please, stop accusing me of bad faith editing. Please, let's focus less on me and your personal issues with me. Anyway, I think the article is in a decent state now. So are there any outstanding issues in the article currently? (I can think of one, see my p. 204 post below). Can we move on past the accusations of OWN and bad faith and discuss article content?-  
  
 '.

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning overestimates the toxicity of the comment due to its length and tone.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
