 Wow! This will raise the number of assessed articles substantially. Do I understand the process correctly, that once tagging is done, a bot will generate overview and stats pages. 
  
 One minor caveat: Award articles, like Wigner medal, all seem to get the ``stub`` category, per ``auto``, allegedly because of a stub template. But: 
 # To the best of my knowledge those articles never had a stub template 
 # IMHO there is no big potential for expansion, either they 
 ## should be considered list-like and excempt from article assessment 
 ## be rated somewhat like ``short, but no need to grow``  a seemingly missing assessment grade 
  
 Only a nitpick in the grand scheme, but I'm just watching a number of those articles, so I was wondering.
