 :Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share.

 :Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems.

 == Seth Material == 
  
 Oasis, thank you for the supportive comments that you made on the Seth Material talk page recently. 
  
 If you are truly a new editor, there are some things you need to know.  Wikipedia's rules governing editing and the behavior of editors are very poorly written.  They encourage people who have nothing else to do to spend hours and hours on the site each day.  However, once an editor has exhausted his knowledge, any contributions he makes after that are of dubious value.  The result is that there are contingents of what I call ``Wiki-addicts`` who make little positive contribution to the encyclopedia, but who make a lot of trouble for other editors.  They generally call themselves ``skeptics``, and they spend hours each day attacking articles they don't like.  They fancy themselves to be guardians of neutrality, but their edits are rarely neutral.  They also fancy themselves to be Wikipedia experts, and consequently they are rarely willing to collaborate.  Generally, they are atheists, right-wing Christians and political conservatives, and they attack articles on topics that are not in the mainstream, especially in the area of religion.  The Seth Material article has suffered from such attacks since it was created a couple years ago.  Recently, several ``skeptics`` ganged up on me and got me kicked off the article.  The editors who are now in control of it have no knowledge of the Seth Material whatsoever, beyond the fact that they don't like it, so the article is now controlled by editors who would prefer to delete the article altogether.  They have already cut out portions of it.  If you want to see the most complete version of the article, look for the version edited by ``Itsmejudith``.  You'll find text in there that has since been deleted. 
  
 Basically, my message to you is that Wikipedia is a hostile environment, especially if you are interested in topics of religion or spirituality.  If you have things to say in those areas, it is best to do it on your own web site.  With so many editors on Wikipedia intent on censoring information they don't like, it is very hard to make contributions in those areas without getting into non-stop edit-wars.  `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen3-4B,1,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 When the word ``Catalán`` appears for the first time. In 1115, mentioned by an italian cronist. 
 When Catalonia became really independent?. By the Treaty of Corbeil, in 1248 when the French Monarchie gave up his rights on the Marca Hispanica castles. 
 Where was the idealised hero of Barcelona Wifredo el Vellosos born  in France, in Carcassone. 
 Was Roger of Lauria, the ``great catalonian hero`` catalán. Not at all, he was born in Lauria (Italy) and served the King of Aragón. 
 Were there Kings in Cataluña. No, never existed. 
 Were there a Principado of Cataluña?. No, never. It is a Prince of Gerona, but never was Cataluña a Principado. 
 Stop trying to be what you are not. You may be proud of some other things, but neither you have ever been a Kingdom, not a Principado, nor you have had a clasic literature in catalán. 
 Catalán is a dialect steaming from latin, exactly the same than castillian, provenzal, italian or valenciano. The difffrence is that, while Valenciano had a dictionary  (Liber Elegantiarum), clasic romans (Tirant lo Blanch), traslations of the Bible to Valenciano (Bonifacio Ferrer), etc..

The edits I did on Love More by Chris Brown, Crooked Smile by J Cole, Jay Z's single being platinum and the sales for several hip hop albums were all correct but you're too butthurt to not undue them because it wasn't directly posted by Billboard until a few days later.

 Fort Plank was the kingpin in a series of western New York Forts. All supplies going to Fort Stanwix passed through her first. The bulk of Indian intelligence from the Oneida Nation was firts delivered to Fort Plank and dispersed from there. My ancestors: George House and Godfrey Cramer were killed in Joseph Brant's August 2, 1780 attack on Fort Plank. My ancestor: Conrad Cramer was captured by the British while out from Fort Plank and held in a Canadian prison for over three years. My ancestor: Daniel Lobdell was captured by the Britis at Yankees Bush on April 3, 1780 and carried to Canada as a prisoner there for three years. While under duress he gave the British inteeligence on troop movemnets to Fort Plank, one must wonder if the helath of his sons Joseph, James, and Zadock (also my ancestor) were threatened before he ``spilled the beans``.

 == Dithering here... == 
  
 I'm sorry we haven't met sooner.  There is another you may wish to acquaint yourself with.  His name is , an Anglo-Saxonist.  English traditionalists (even the pro-Celtic, pro-Roman) are apparently the bane of the British Isles here at Wikipedia, but I don't know about that in real life, considering such a sentiment is supposedly more tolerant.  Yes, it's said to be more accepting than the ``proud Teutonic`` approach to English identification, although it seems as though the Celtofascists here are trying to spin the English alone as ``foreign`` to the Isles, even though it is easy to discover the Celtic origins in Roman Europe, especially the Brythonic kind (as much as Anglo-Saxon European ties are to the post-Classical Rome of Charlemagne and other Holy Roman ``Germanics``).  They think that pro-Celtic, pro-Roman means hostile cultural appropriation, as they have identified you as ``the other``, the big pink elephant in the room.  It is a sight for sore eyes to see how you manage to reconcile hostile, ``mutual-exclusionary`` factions of Celt, Roman and German, for most ``people`` involved in these articles have one agenda to push or another, but hardly any singular Romanists, I'm afraid.  Perhaps I should try that.  Imagine the double-whammy of negativity from the ``Celto-Germanicists``.  Ahh...there's no way to achieve anything in any of this without some bloodshed, it seems. 
  
 Incidentally, if you'd like to get worked up elsewhere, go check out the archives of that talk page...here, for instance.  In that article, it is apparently considered nonsense by  that the Greeks bestowed the name ``British Isles`` upon that set of islands off of Gaul and that is the ultimate origin, as they instead focus exclusively upon the Tudor-Stuart settlement (extreme violation of WP:WEIGHT and barely even narrowly WP:SYNTH, so wrapped up in violations of WP:NOR!) which modernised the term and put ancient ethnic vagueness into political effect (nor do they care to see that Roman Britain was only that part of Albion, that part of the BI in total which had been conquered or annexed through treaty by Rome, even as Erin would go free...not contradicting the fact that they are both ``British``, whatever that originally meant aside from the Trojan story).  Just about any and all BI related pages are vicious black holes and often, the only way to go about it, is by using extreme caution and wisdom.  You will find that whilst your attackers see fit to add and add as they wish, their abuse of you is based upon their own convictions of what they would like to edit one way or the other and if you don't fit their profile, then ``you are wrong``, not just what you happen to do or write, it is a personal vendetta to expunge all of your works.  Many times, after selecting a target, they are simply being difficult and if they are lucky enough, they will have provoked thee into becoming banned, just to see you squirm, as they do whatever it is they wish, to put the spin on this or that subject, according to their absolutist truisms.  Of course, you are unable to do anything about it when your editing privileges are revoked and the admins won't even bother to level the playing field for you, only acquiesce to their demands based in vilification and lynchmobbery.  They will, most likely, base their complaints upon ``improper procedures``, which is Orwellian codespeak for ``we don't like what he stands for, let's overwhelm him in numbers``. 
  
 All said, it is very nice to meet you...you, like me, with a youthful tenure here being quite deceiving, would probably enjoy this a lot.

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic) based on your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers so they can implement their true aggregate decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.
