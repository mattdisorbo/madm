 Hello, Deval khandelwal, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for . 
  
 I notice that one of the first articles you created  appears to be an article about yourself. This is a common mistake made by new Wikipedians—as this is an encyclopedia, we wouldn't expect to have an article about every contributor. Your user page, however, is a great place to write about yourself, making sure to stay within user page guidelines. Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit it normally. 
  
 The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page. 
  
 If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers: 
 *The five pillars of Wikipedia 
 *How to edit a page 
 *Help pages 
 *Tutorial 
 *How to write a great article 
 *Manual of Style 
 I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian! Please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes (~~~~); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Where to ask a question or ask me on . Again, welcome!

 == Follow-up re new medal icons for medals tables == 
  
 Well, this has been finally implemented, and I think the new icons are a radical improvement over the previous color blocks.  The medals table of Nicole Haislett looks remarkably cleaner and more graphically refined, and we may now replace many of the artificially abbreviated place names and event descriptions that were previously employed to avoid line-wrapping within the medals tables.  A couple of points remain to be discussed and resolved: 
  
 #  how do we handle the graphics for the ``disqualified`` medal option? 
 #  what do we do about the winner, runner-up and playoff options that were engrafted onto this template by an association football editor in 2011? 
  
 I'm bringing these issues here first, SFB, because you (a) are obviously not opposed to change, and (b) have a good eye for better graphics.  I would like to get on the same page with you before starting another template talk page discussion. 
  
 My suggestion for the ``disqualified`` issue would be to fill square area surrounding the circular medal icon with a percentage screen of red, with a red diagonal bar drawn across the icon itself  that screams intuitive.  The disqualified option should also include a field for explanatory footnote text.  Another simpler alternative is to omit disqualified medals altogether. 
  
 As for the winner, runner-up and playoffs options for association football/soccer, I seriously question whether these should be included in a ``medals`` table at all.  Having looked at several dozen footballer infoboxes that use these options, it also appears that many uses are for minor regional, national and subnational tournaments.  Frankly, I wonder if WP:FOOTY has even sanctioned many of these minor tournament outcomes for inclusion; most of them do not appear to be medal competitions, so the use of the gold, silver and bronze background colors is inaccurate.  I'm going to ping , and ask him for a football editor's perspective  WP:FOOTY is ultimately going to have make the decision or otherwise cooperate on a resolution of this.  It goes without saying that the new medal icons are graphically inconsistent with the color bar text blocks for ``Winner,`` ``Runner-up`` and ``Playoffs.``    `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen3-8B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 hello im new to this and dont quite no how i would send you a message through this?  
 but how would we be able to discuss the Alawi page?  
 i found some things that you were tryin to explain be incorrect. Every Alawi person i no Woships the Imam Ali in the Shia way, and worship all of the Prophet Mohammads family, and the we worship both the Prophet Mohammad and the Imam Ali, and follow both their teaching, we do not just follow the Imam Ali teachings, we follow the Prophets as well. Alawi int he past 50 years have become closer to Shia, and do not celebrate Christmas. Or any other Christian Eids. I know from me and my family we celebrate all Shia Eids, and for Ramadan nearly every year we choose to fast. And yes our teachings are kept private (not secrete) —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •     
 *Well, we should probably discuss this on the talk page on the Alawi article, but anyway, I believe the Alawite beliefs vary quite a bit, my family do for example celebrate Christmas and other Christian festivals, but they are Lebanese, so they may have retained more of the original Alawite beliefs than the ones in Syria, who try harder to be accepted as true Muslims, so that the validity of Bashar Assad's presidency isn't questioned.     
  
 My family is Alawi, and we celebrate the Shia Eids. We dont celebrate Christmas how can we, when we dont believe the story of the 3 wise men, ad we dont believe in Joseph, to Muslims Marry wasnt married and God had sent ``Zacaria`` to guard her.et c  
 The part about How we Worship the Imam Al, to Alawi we follow both Teachings of the Imam Ali and the Prophet Mohammad. None of them come first, in your case your kinda saying that Ali comes first before the prophet. Alawi only have the Quran and their own scriputres as Islamic text. And iv read from other websites that Aparantly Alawi worship the Imam ALi like a God, when we dont. When you are trying to Explain the Trinity thing, your as basicly saying that we belive Ali is God, in 3 forms, which complely contridicts the point of us being Muslim. That there is no one but Allah and there is only One god, and he has no sons etc. And we believe in Rencarnation as is. And your should say that when the boys study the Alawi text, you should say after 15/16 boys can choose to go deeper into the relgion and study more, or choose not to study more. i no from my grandfather he went deep into the relgion and spent his whole life studying it. Where as my dad stoped when he got married and had kids (so around 22).  
 *Well, I didn't write the article, and I'm not sure who added the trinity stuff, but if it isn't sourced, it probably shouldn't be there. As for beliefs, well, as I mentioned before, the Alawites in Syria have changed their beliefs to become more like mainstream Muslims, so many of the older traditions might not be practiced there. It's different in Lebanon though, where the Syrian government is unable to regulate the sects like in Syria.

Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers so they can implement their true aggregate decision.

A pedophile is just as capable of editing with a neutral POV on a subject matter dealing with pedophilia, as a Jew or a black would be on an issue that involves Jews or blacks.

 == 'Assessment' vs. 'diagnosis' == 
  
 This section was moved here from /Comments subpage by Cs   
  
 I am new to this, and finding my way, so sorry if I get things wrong. I am a British Art Therapist(and a Council Member, British Association of Art Therapists). The art therapy article as it stands is very US based, and there are significant differences. I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind. My first proposed addition is this, in the section on assessment tools: 
  
 'It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally. 'Assessment' is easily confused with 'diagnosis'.

 == 'Assessment' vs. 'diagnosis' == 
  
 This section was moved here from /Comments subpage by Cs   
  
 I am new to this, and finding my way, so sorry if I get things wrong. I am a British Art Therapist(and a Council Member, British Association of Art Therapists). The art therapy article as it stands is very US based, and there are significant differences. I propose to start contributing to the page with this in mind. My first proposed addition is this, in the section on assessment tools: 
  
 'It is important to note however that attitudes to assessment differ internationally. 'Assessment' is easily confused with 'diagnosis'. Because diagnosis is a medical function rather than a therapeutic one, British art therapists tend to resist the implied medicalisation of what is essentially a non medical approach, which concentrates on 'seeing the person, not the label'. The British Association of Art Therapists statement on diagnosis simply states that ‘Art Therapists do not diagnose…' (http://www.baat.org.uk)' 
  
 Any thoughts on this before I go ahead?`'.

 == Jesus's name == 
  
 Hi, I appreciate all your questions and wish to understand the matter.  If you really want to know why the article, for most of its life, has not included anything about Jesus' ``Hebrew name`` or ``Aramaic`` name in the lead, I encourage you to look at the talk page archives, as we had at least two lengthy discussions when, two times in the past, someone proposed this (what bothers me about the current situation is, someone changed the long-standing consensus version without any such discussion). 
  
 Did you know that many Pharisees who lived around the time of Jesus had Greek names or Greek derived names (Greek names spelled out in Hebrew letters)? Tarfon, Antigonus, Abtalion ... These are actually names of Rabbis recorded in the Mishnah, who probably spoke Aramaic on a daily basis, and Hebrew in their studies (the Mishnah is written in Hebrew) - yet they had Greek or ``Hellenized`` names.  Alexander was a popular name at this time. This of course does not mean that Jesus was given a Greek name rather than a Hebrew name, or a ``Hellenized`` Hebrew name, when he was born. We have no idea. It probably is not likely, but we have no idea. This is not ``my`` point, but one brought up by many editors who have made major contributions to the Jesus article.  
  
 I think it is pretty standard practice throughout Wikipedia that, when an article wishes to address a complex issues - perhaps because it is controversial, or there are many diverse views, or it is speculative, or for whatever reason, requires time to explain to readers why there is no certainty, why it is not a ``fact`` - we do not shy away from such topics but rather address them in the body of the article but not in the lede.  For very obvious reasons, we do not mention in the lede everything that is in the body.  I don't object to including speculation in the article, but until someone added this stuff sometime in the past month, there was a consensus among all the editors who had made major contributions to the article not to put this speculation in the lead.     |   `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen3-8B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]
