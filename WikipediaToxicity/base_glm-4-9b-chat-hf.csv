 == Re: Winans Family == 
  
 I fully understand your concerns about the new user but I think if we send him/her a message, they'll understand. I mean, the article is geared towards the musical family...I could understand if Matthew was one of the Winans kids but he's their third cousin or something like that. Honestly, he just isnt pertinent to the article. As for the NPOV statement, the main problem were statements like ``his love and passion is basketball`` which make it sound more like an advertisement. Granted, this only occured once or twice but nonetheless its there.

 == Re: Winans Family == 
  
 I fully understand your concerns about the new user but I think if we send him/her a message, they'll understand. I mean, the article is geared towards the musical family...I could understand if Matthew was one of the Winans kids but he's their third cousin or something like that. Honestly, he just isnt pertinent to the article. As for the NPOV statement, the main problem were statements like ``his love and passion is basketball`` which make it sound more like an advertisement. Granted, this only occured once or twice but nonetheless its there. Also, theres way too much information on him here, more than the actual Winans family are given (granted, many of them have their own pages). Why dont we just make Matthew his own page and then under the trivia section say ``The Winans are cousins of basketball player Matthew Winans``. I think thats the best compromise...what do you think?

 And I would very much like to know who you think you are and who appointed you on that page? 
 For your knowledge Meru was officilly placed here to watch this talk page by mediator Nicholas Turnbull, and this talking is in the process on entering the arbitation comity, so your interventions here are so outplaced as they can be! 
 I talked with Nicholas Turnbull tonight who disagree with your actions. 
 You are not appointed here and do not have to make decisions above the heads of the members of the arbitration comity, so you will be very kind to step aside and anihilate your previous doing. 
 This is not your playground. 
 I do not know what are your motives to acting as you do as nobody has ever seen you here, but you do seems to go at it with a revenge. 
 Any reasons who would be worth mentioning now? 
 You have just been elected admi and the first thing you do is blocking and banning fox from a site you don't know and that you were not aware of for 24 hours ago. 
 This don't go, you are overstepping wikis rules and previously made decision about this talkpage. 
 You are acting very unbalanced and provocating a chaos who wasn't there before and who in fact wasn't there as far as the 22th of september. Isn't your role to make things work?  
 Another veru very important thing is that you are walking on my article about a Settlement Proposal, that I do recommend you to read carefully, and that you don't have answer to in your recents edits above, and who therefor have no place what so ever under my article and as a part of it. 
 So moove your articles above, to follow suite of your childrens fights, and leave the growing up doing the right thing. 
 This article above was the one I was writng and in fact inserted in Meru own talk page before you made your intrance here, and before the situation degenerated that much. 
 I did it in an attempt to calm tempers down and create a new tangible goal with better opportunity to solve this dilema than revert war and banishments war. 
 I was stopped at inserting my article by constant editing of article from people fighting, and had each time to perform some changement of my article before saving it, at the end it was too late, you hade arrived, talk like césar, ban a person wihtout valuable and argued explainations, without warning, and taken over the role assignated to Meru by N. Turnbull a few days ago. 
  
 By the time I arrived to save my article about burrying the hachet, heads had already rolled, thanks for you. 
 For your knowledge, you did it at midnight, a saturday evening, and this kind of action will have required the presence of more users, and an agreement between those. 
 Your opinion about the presence of Igor or not on his talkpage is none of your business, but the business of the arbitration comity and their decision, not yours. 
 You will have to be more patient and leave to other the right to decide. 
 Know your chain of command, and the wikis appointed chain of event before a ban can take place, specialy a definitiv ban! 
 What about the other guy who begin this reverting phase all together? isn't he guilty as well or is he your personnal friend in the discussion forum? 
 For if this is the case, and if you do have preferences for who is right and who is wrong, so you shouldn't be here and make interventions as well. 
 You have to stay neutral, but your judgement sounds arbitrary to me, to the point that even your collegue Meru didn't understood what and why you were doing this and disagreed. 
 Why are you making troubles, and tell me why the alone person who support your actions, is rjb, the exact person known for insulting peoples very often, reverting all the time, and having started this reverting war completely iognoring previous concensus made about the contain of the biography on this talk page. 
 He was destroying the work of people, to who it had taken several weeks to obtain. 
 You didn't baned him, why? Is he your socket puppet, or are you his? 
 What were you doing 6 hours ago and why did you came here? 
 Did someone warned you? 
 What triggered your hush at coming by, first time, so late? 
 I would very much like to know. 
  
 You will please move your dispute and different blowings up on one another on a different place, and will take your bad saturday night mood swing somewhere else than on this talkpage, unless you have a satisfactory explaination for what just did happened. 
 You can't ban Igor when Holger Beck Nielsen is going to make an intervention on this talk page. I hope you know who this person is. 
 i do notice that the 2 persons who made reverting a war, and insisted on it are ybm and rjb who are both in very close contact with each other, and in fact I am quiet sure that rjb is The socket puppet of YBM.

 == The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. == 
  
 An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote: 
  
 :The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream. 
  
 The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the ``purple patch that began with...,`` etc.  This seems clear to me.

 Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.

 Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta: 
 «And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired. 
  
 Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage. 
 - 
 Abhay composed a Bengali poem, ``Vṛndāvana-bhajana.`` Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal. 
  
 I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma. 
 In this mood I am getting many realizations. 
 I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything, 
 But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory. 
 Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature; 
 By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today. 
 Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ: 
 ``I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful.``  
 How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?» 
  
 Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke. 
  
 Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference: 
  
 «Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Yet, on the other hand, one does not want to completely avoid the use the accurate legal terms for those readers who understand and appreciate their use.

 This review does not exist on the 3D World website, the link is to the homepage of that website. There are no other external links under references that can be used to verify any of the text on the Wikipedia page. Some of the articles cited are recent so a link to the article on the web version of the newspapers should be provided. The ABC artist profile is the only reliable source and is dated, from 2003 and refers only to a local dance music scene. Many of the links under External Links are broken.  
  
 Much of the information appears to be fabricated as it does not appear anywhere else when performing a Google search.  
 Colloquial language in background information: ``Website  	 Little Nobody's dodgy MySpace site``. This indicates that the article is largely a puff piece.  
  
 Thus, articles related to Little Nobody and IF Records should be removed for:

 Very soon we all will find more, about who you are. 
  
    
  
 Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues 
  
 You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's. 
  
 Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?! 
  
 Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with. 
  
 The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist. 
  
 Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers. 
  
 What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility. 
  
 It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action. 
  
 And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past. 
  
 It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone.

 Very soon we all will find more, about who you are. 
  
    
  
 Public Statement by Mark Bellinghaus regarding the bias edits and tries to further slander him and his colleagues 
  
 You continue to edit out three important articles that were printed and published in the Los Angeles Times. Why? Instead you are pushing for a blog post which is absolute nonsense. You are adding a two piece article which is a one sided attack on me, Mark Bellinghaus. I have never had a 'dispute' with Brandon James, since I have not contacted him, as he claimed in the article published by the OC Register. They also published other lies, which since have been removed due to my protest and conversation with their attorney. Please edit in good faith and stick to the truth. I will file a protest with Wikipedia, because what is happening is a continuation of the planned out in detail slander, character defamation and assassination by a small group of people who are obviously connected to and behind the fraud crimes, the criminal hoaxes which we exposed and debunked. This article is literally a stage for book projects such as June DiMaggio's and Jeanne Carmen's. 
  
 Maybe the time has come that we must also expose the real person behind Delicious carbuncle?! 
  
 Again, I knew that I would become the target of the criminals who I stopped screwing over the general public with their gimmicks, attached to the legacy of Marilyn Monroe. But I will use my clear and given right to defend what we, three people who did care and worked for this for the past three years have achieved and succeeded with. 
  
 The LA TIMES articles must be added to this article, and the CITIZEN is a dead blog, which was a favor/favour  posted by a friend, this is how this lady introduced herself to me on the phone when she called me up, of Kenneth Knoll, the friend and manager of the June DiMaggio book project. She quoted me out of context and she admitted to me that she is NOT a press agency or journalist. 
  
 Regarding the Brandon James claims which you willingly added. I have never spoken to Brandon James, ever since I was introduced to him and his mother in 2005. He followed me to every blog, every website. Attacked us, hidden behind monikers. 
  
 What is happening here right now is an example of some bias people who have created this to destroy our credibility. 
  
 It is a sad act of cutting off our freedom of speech and also trying to diminish our success in terms of the fraud exposures. Who is behind this? We do know exactly who is and we already have taken action. 
  
 And that exposure is way more interesting than anything we have taken on in the past. 
  
 It has also to do with cyber bullying, since I am being portrayed as a monster. I am being compared to Charles Manson and Berkowitz and that website was posted anonymously in Malaysia. These people want me to go the Megan Meier way. They have already told me to kill myself. Not once, but twice. They have called me a 'pedophile' and other insults. They have claimed that I made bomb threats when I have never ever threatened anyone. At all. I have never extorted anyone. You people, hiding behind your funny and also so believable names, you know why you are doing this and why you are using Wikipedia, to destroy my name, completely. When I protested on the 45th anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death, outside the chapel, I had my reason.

Haha, I guess I gave away I was Eoganan when I used my German, whoops ! And just to let you know, background in some cases is identical to ethnicity, and even when it isnt, its still a big part of it. Just because there is an old connection to people in Iberia dont make English related to Spaniards. That connection is old and shared by all west European peeps. English and Spanish have mixed with other origins and NO ONE (Syke, Oppen, whatev) think that Brits are completely descended from that old population. Ethnicity is a bunch of things, including descent, but without descent, theres no ethnicity, there is other things that are part of it but not identical to it. Our appearance comes from some of our genes, yeah ? Basques look different from Spaniards and they both def look alot different from Irish, and Brits ! Brits and Irish look more like each other and nearby peeps like dutch and germans more than people from Iberia. The connection to Iberia is a PARTIAL one, got it ? Anyway, in ethnicity, you can say any people is related to anyone, as long as theyre human, right ? Brits and Irish are related a little bit to peeps in Iberia, but its a PARTIAL and REALLY OLD connection. Brits and Irish are also related in the same way to all Western Europeans but mostly to each other. English and Scottish have that same really old Iberian link with Scandinavians, Frisians, Germans, but also other genetic links that they dont have with people in Iberia. You include other parts of ethnicity and there u have why English and Scottish are more related to other Northern Europeans than they are to peeps from Iberia. BOOM, think about that for a while sucka ! Haha, now you know you been beaten, take it like a man for once, haha !
