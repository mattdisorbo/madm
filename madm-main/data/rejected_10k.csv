1796,10000.0,2007-10-17,"I am a railroad engineer for CSX transportation and am relocating my family to North Carolina.  In order to do this move, we need to settle all of our delinquent debts and move with a clean slate.   My family is my wife, Stacey, our 3 year old daughter, Mackenzie, and our 11 month old son, Noah.   We have a doggie named Dickens, and yes, of course, he's family.  It will cost us a few thousand to relocated with a moving company.  We need payment to rent an apartment and security, etc.    I will be starting a new position in North Carolina, so we will be with little pay until my training session ends.  We need to be able to have money for rent and take care of the children's needs for at least a couple months.    Thank you for your kind consideration.  Mike ",468.0,11.93%,132xx,NY,2 years,0.0

1851,25000.0,2007-10-19,"Greetings!  My wife and I recently purchased a new house in the Palm Springs area and began renting out our first home.  The new home is a condo unit in a country club and was built in the 1950's in a contemporary style.  Even though it is structurally sound, since it is an older place, we undertook a few small projects to update certain areas and improve certain features (such as improving the airflow for our air conditioner).  We ended up overspending our budget, and ended up putting the excess on our credit cards.  We are looking to consolidate some credit card debt that we incurred in the process of fixing up our new place.  I had heard about peer-to-peer lending sites in Consumer Reports' Money magazine, and we are looking to give it a try!",679.0,18.9%,922xx,CO,< 1 year,0.0

3303,15000.0,2007-11-27,"Nobody ever wants to go in to debt. When I met my husband 4 years ago, I had a few small credit cards that I was able to pay off without much help. I thought I was home free after that.  Well, things change. In late 2004, I was laid off two weeks before Christmas. That same week, we got a $300 gas bill and our only car died. We had no other option but to take out a $5000 line of credit to get a car. I started looking for work right away, but as the months rolled by, we had to turn to the line of credit to live.  Not too long after I was laid off, I found out I was pregnant. We were excited, yet terrified. How would we afford this on one income? I eventually did get a job, but making less than $7 an hour part time didn't do much at all. Our beautiful daughter came into the world on September 13, 2005. Soon after, we got a credit card to transfer some high interest balances and pay off our hospital bill.  For a while, things were okay. We weren't doing great, but we were surviving. Day by day, we sunk further into debt. And then the unthinkable happened- my husband was laid off. We both looked for jobs, but nothing came in for four months.  Another credit card entered the scene, which we essentially lived off of.  Excluding my looming student loans (I graduate in May), our current debt hovers around the $15,000 mark. My school schedule and my husband's work schedule finally allowed me to go back to work in August. Two incomes is better than one, but we're still struggling.  Getting a loan to consolidate everything would be a life saver. We're paying as high as 19% interest on one credit card. With student loan payments in the near future, and wanting to have another baby, it's essential to get our debt paid down.  ",669.0,32.62%,681xx,NE,< 1 year,0.0

What we are trying to do is consolidate the debt acrued during the move and buy the essentials for our new arrival. We have managed to buy a crib and dresser, but still need much more! We would also like to put some in savings and be able to buy our 11 year old son a few things for Christmas as well.

3602,12450.0,2007-12-01,"WHY I NEED A LOAN 	Sixteen years ago I started a business that was on its way the first 12 months to netting $120,000- pretax profit. 	Then, suddenly, I had a nervous breakdown. Couldn't work. No motivation. Exhausted my savings. Had to go on early, discounted Social Security. 	Thanks largely to my anti-depressant, I chucked all symptoms except one: no matter how early nor late I went to bed, I couldn't get up in the morning for work. If I tried even walking downstairs for the paper before my brain said ""OK,"" I'd get sick to my stomach, unable to do anything productive the rest of the day. 	I got wind of a hospital's sleep lab. ""You have 'restless leg syndrome,' advised the doctor. ""I'd like to start you on this new medicine.""  	A few weeks ago I realized that no matter what time I had been going to bed, so long as my brain was comfortable with the notion...and I had had 8 to 9 hours in bed the night before, I could safely get up for the day. Nor, most times, would I feel the least drowsy until bedtime. 	From a previous 14 to 15 total bed hours nightly  I had needed for several previous years, I now needed but 8 or 9. 	My doctor and I both figure that, if I was ""running a Marathon nightly in my sleep, eventually I'd run out of energy. And stop thrashing. And sleep motionless. Until rested. No wonder I needed 6-7 extra hours in bed.""  MY FINANCIAL SITUATION 	Voila! I could now re-start my profession. Except..........the paradox...the irony of it all...was...now that I'm fit and ready to roll, I don't have the money I need to jump-start my former business.                 I'm confident I'll net at least $100,000- first 12 months. 	While I was a New York City-based actor, I taught as a hired gun for Communispond, the world's first, and by far premier trainers of top, multi-national, corporate executives in stand-up presentation and media skills. 3,000 +  CEOs, EVPs and other officers, supervisors and ""comers"" with such well-known, respected companies as IBM, GM, ATT, PepsiCo, 3M, etc. 	A typical post-program participant comment was, ""Wow! I should have taken this 20 years ago!""                 I quit in order to create a more versatile, measurable program. I researched, developed, tested before audiences the most versatile, most effective, simplest to use stand-up presentation skills program on the world market. 	It serves any speaker, under any circumstances, speaking to any size audience on any topic on which the speaker is expert. And.....measure results against intention.....anonymously. 	I give a full, money-back guarantee. My graduates (1) don't memorize a thing, (2) don't use notes, (3) they neither write nor read long-winded, boring, speeches! 	I got six huge photo-features in major NYC suburban daily papers, plus, a piece in an Albuquerque, New Mexico daily. 	I wrote and published PRESENTER.

4090,3500.0,2007-12-09,"Good day, I appreciate your consideration of my loan request.   Currently, I work as an independent contractor for the Federal Government, driving for a limousine service which transports Congressmen, Senators and other Government officials around Washington, DC. I am a very trustworthy and honest person with security clearance and have been with this company for almost 2 years. Prior to that, I managed a restaurant for over 20 years.   Purpose of Loan:  If I am fortunate to be granted a loan through LendingClub, I would use the money to pay my son's medical bill.  He has a $2,500 medical bill that I would like to pay off for him.   This is not a loan out of necessity....I am relatively debt free and have few expenses. I recently moved into my son's in-law suite in his home and do not have to pay rent, nor do I have any other living expenses such as utilities, however, I do help out with groceries and other small expenses.   Total Amount Requested: $3500 Monthly Net Income: I earn an average of $3,000/mo. net from my job as a diplomatic chauffeur, not including overtime.   Monthly Expenses BEFORE LendingClub Loan: $1,110  Housing: $ 0  Insurance: $ 110  Car expenses: $ 200  Utilities: $ 0  Phone, cable, internet: $ 0  Food, entertainment: $ 300  Clothing, household expenses $ 100  Credit cards and other loans: $ 150  Other expenses: $ 250   Monthly Expenses AFTER LendingClub Loan: $1,250(includes LendingClub loan payment of $150)   As you can see, I will have $1,800 left from my salary after payment of my LendingClub loan.   I have good credit and take my obligations very seriously.  According to my Experian credit report, my credit score is 712. I pride myself on always making my payments on time & will continue to do so with this LendingClub loan. I have a very clean credit history with NO Delinquencies in the past seven years. Improving my credit score is extremely important to me. I can reassure lenders that their investment in me is very safe. The repayment of my LendingClub loan will be the 1st priority each month, with payments automatically withdrawn from my bank account. I promise to make all my payments on time & never default on this loan. Thank you again for considering my loan request!  ",684.0,14.7%,200xx,DC,2 years,0.0

I am a business owner starting up a personal development and coaching company, but I cannot help others if this does not get taken care of.  Once this loan is completed I will offer free coaching and free access to all of the books I have authored as a bonus.

4275,20000.0,2007-12-12,"This loan is to help pay off a high interest rate credit card and allow us (me and my wife) to save money or to boost the payment of the credit card account.   We both have a stable work at the University and medical center.  I am a very hard worker, and a valuable member of my research laboratory and the University.  My wife also works with me in the same division.  I use to have a good credit score because I make payments on time, every time.  I pay my bills before they are due, but lately, because of the high APR of my credit card, we have been very tight to keep this good history going.  We don�t want to �consolidate� or �settle� our payment, because we want to keep our account history.  There is no intention to fall in the credit �trap� again.  Lowering my APR, we�ll be ok, and in our way to pursue our financial plan.  I�m sure that in a short period of time we�ll pay our debt, and we�ll also be in the position to turn around and help others.  Thank you for considering my loan.  ",667.0,27.84%,331xx,FL,1 year,0.0

I had never gave this a thought before the divorce but now I find that it is not a good thing not to have some debt!  I am a 30-year old other of two.  I have a positive work history and steady income.  I feel that financially I am in a good place but this is not reflected by my credit report since I have never had credit!!!

5284,7000.0,2008-01-01,"This loan will be used provide working capital for a small start up business started earlier this year. The company is a LLC on record with the sectary of state for the state I reside in. The money will be  will be used to help fund two business ventures, and to help with other business related cost.  The first business venture will be the purchase of a vehicle (and a warranty for the vehicle) that I intend to sell with owner financing. I consider a large portion of this loan secured by the vehicle because it will be equipped with GPS tracking and fully insured by our self or the buyer. I will make sure this transaction is in state compliance, and I have checked wit the DMV and the Department of Revenue in my state. Both told me by phone that this is ok. With a steady paying customer, this will provide extra income steam that will be used for repayment of this loan.   The second business venture is the main part of the company. These funds will be used to finance our marketing efforts to used car dealers and to cover any other business related costs. The company has agreements and relationships with finance companies that can provide this capital, and of course compensate us for brokering the deal. Currently I have just launched a new website, done some advertising with a state independent auto dealers association, started some direct mail, and I do some cold calling to dealers that may have an interest in our service.   I could obtain some of this money from my credit cards,however, the rates and fees associated with these cash advances are pretty high and I would love to be able to borrow the money at a lower rate.  I am new to the Lending club website and community, but I look forward to great things.   Any questions related to this loan or my business are welcomed.",684.0,69.05%,292xx,SC,< 1 year,0.0

I am currently taking a career in real estate under a very successful investor. With real estate the money comes in but sometimes comes in slow. I am looking to establish a steady stream of cash flow. I am looking to do this with purchasing profitable income generating web sites. Based off my calculations. I will be able to pay a credit repair company to manage and pay off ALL my debt. as well as have enough cash left over to invest in my first car and eventually my own place. With this loan I will be able to kick start my life and gain independence in 2008.    Thank You. ",485.0,1560%,935xx,CA,< 1 year,0.0

5742,8000.0,2008-01-08,"Just passed 4-hour CA state exam to move up from licensed to certified residential appraiser.  When the state issues the document, my earning ability will increase by 40%. I am currently paying other appraisers that 40% for each report I do: as a licensed appraiser I am required by law to have a certified appraiser review my work for high-value properties).  However, the collapse of the subprime market has devalued my home, so that I am no longer able to tap my home equity line of credit to help carry me through to the higher earnings plateau.  I am beginning to fall behind on my mortgage and credit card payments. This has impacted on my (until recently excellent) credit score.  This is a TEMPORARY situation.  I have worked very hard to reach this level in my profession.

5744,2000.0,2008-01-08,"My request for this loan is to consolidate my debt.   I've racked up credit card debt and on my way to paying every cent.   The debt came mainly from school expenses and trying to maintain a dying car. Now that I'm six months into a new job and my transportation issues have been resolved I'm more that motivated to get rid of this debt.  Though it's not much debt, I would much rather pay interest to the members of this community vs. the credit card companies that take advantage of their card members.",701.0,32.78%,300xx,GA,< 1 year,0.0

6190,800.0,2008-01-13,"Hi - I would like the money to finally pay off a medical debt from 2004.  I am fortunate now to be able to use my education in my wonderful job.  I had to move in October to be closer to my job since I was commuting 130 miles per day.  I have a house where I live and I did not sell my house where I came from yet.  I do have two house payments but can afford them.  I would like to have this debt paid off because it will improve my  FICO score.  I had to have emergency surgery in grad school and was off work for over 5 months.  I graduated on time thanks to lots of hard work.  In my current situation it is difficult to come up with the money to pay this debt off.  Any help is appreciated!  This is the best job I have ever had.  Before I made only $9.00 per hours to maybe $13.00 an hours as a clinical social worker.  Now I make over $70,000 a year counting my pension.",666.0,27.94%,524xx,IA,< 1 year,0.0

I have been on interviews and I am waiting to see if I have been hired, which will happen by the end of January. I will be getting paid starting in February. However if I am not hired, the teacher retirement money, which I have already applied for will be here in about 8 weeks. If I am offered a job before that time, I will take it, if not I will use retirement to pay loan. I had to resign my last job due to a temporary health issue which has been resolved.  I appreciate any help at a reasonable interest rate. Thank you.                               Sincerely,                                Carolyn A. Stewart",600.0,21.34%,773xx,TX,10+ years,0.0

7345,3000.0,2008-01-20,"I would like to simply pay off and chop up all of my credit cards.  My credit needs to improve and I feel that having all of these credit cards (6) is not the way to do it.  My payments are on time and usually twice the minimum required payment (or more) but I still feel behind.  I do plan on keeping only one card for the sake of my credit needing some activity but it will be used very rarely.  Five of the cards are store cards that I really don't want to shop at.  I am trying to purchase a home in the near future so I think that this consolidation could really give me a boost; as well as peace of mind.  My boyfriend and I have a three-step plan in mind: step one is to purchase a home, (which is proving to be much more difficult than anticipated) step two will be marriage, and step three will be making some brothers and/or sisters for our already 6-year-old daughter.  I have confidence that this consolidation could really get us on the right track, finally, to our three-step plan.  ",628.0,81.46%,028xx,RI,< 1 year,0.0

8403,4100.0,2008-02-05,"This money will be used to fund my Roth IRA for 2007.  The market is down and this is the best time to fund it.  The reason my credit rating is low is because in October of last year, I did an APP-0-RAMA, basically applied for a bunch of 0% credit cards, and stuck the money in online savings accounts earning between 4 - 5%.  My FICO score at that time was 761.  Not sure what it is now, but my liquid assets total $190,000, and my total outstanding debt totals $69,000.  I would have no problem paying this off.  I just don't want to use credit card money that is only temporarily mine, nor do I want to sell my mutual funds in a down market.  Hope this clarifies my rating.",634.0,50.15%,622xx,IL,8 years,0.0

They were a quick resource on the way to improve our professional development, now they have hiked up the interest and we would much rather this interest go to an individual than the credit card companies.  This loan will be used strictly pay off these high-interest credit cards.  We are secure candidates for this loan because we have the capacity and responsibility to pay back all the money. Actually we are paying completely and on time our debs, keeping a good credit record, but without any possibility to safe money for our future plans. The loan will help us to improve our credit and have a better and stronger economic start point. We are prepared committed professionals with steady jobs in a promising work environment.

9089,7400.0,2008-02-13,"With this loan I plan to pay off most of my revolving credit card balances.   Those credit cards include: Wamu - 1900.00 Macys - 901 Capitalone 880.00 Bofa Amex - 1700 Zales - 180 Bestbuy - 600 Chase - 100  other debts owed: 1300.00  I don't have any problems paying my credit cards monthly, it would just be nice to have one set payment at a certain amount/interest rate monthly. It's hard juggling around multiple payments at different interest rates.  My debt is over the amount I am asking for because I would like to keep my monthly payment for the loan at a max of $260.00.   This loan will help me consolidate all of my debts into the one payment I am hoping for, at a decent rate that I will be able to pay off a lot sooner then with just paying a little over the minimum monthly payments.  Thank you for you time, Sarah ",649.0,20.92%,950xx,CA,< 1 year,0.0

They are good investments, but it's taken longer than I expected to see a decent ROI (as most internet marketers will testify), and in the meantime, some of them are set to renew. I use eBay and freelance writing to supplement my income.  I am starting to see returns on my internet marketing ventures and expect to receive my first big affiliate payment next month. I am close to completing my first novel, I have built several sites that now receive significant daily traffic, and I am learning more programing skills as well as working on fashion dsign/costuming in my spare time so that if my writing is not profitable, I can start an online clothing business instead.",666.0,117.6%,150xx,PA,< 1 year,0.0
