SOLUTION AND REASONING: We are given a stack of $ 2n $ cards numbered from 1 to $ 2n $, from top to bottom.

### Step 1: Understand the restacking process

- **Pile A** is the top $ n $ cards: positions 1 to $ n $.
- **Pile B** is the bottom $ n $ cards: positions $ n+1 $ to $ 2n $.
- The cards are **restacked** by alternately taking from the **top of pile B** and the **top of pile A**, starting with pile B.

Let’s define
CRITIQUE: The proposed solution correctly identifies the restacking process and the goal of finding the number of cards in a magical stack where card 131 retains its original position. However, it does **not** fully solve the problem. To find the number of cards in the magical stack, we need to:

1. Determine the position of each card in the original stack.
2. Determine the position of each card after restacking.
3. Find the value of $ 2n $ such that **card 131 retains its original position** and **at least one card from each pile retains its original position**.

Implement your solution (0) or delegate to Person 1 (1). Respond with the digit ONLY.
