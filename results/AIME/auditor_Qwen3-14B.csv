You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: There is a prime number $p$ such that $16p+1$ is the cube of a positive integer.  Find $p$ ..

[THOUGHT]
We are given that there is a **prime number** $ p $ such that:

$$
16p + 1 = n^3
$$

for some **positive integer** $ n $. Our goal is to find the prime number $ p $.

---

### Step 1: Rearranging the equation

From the given:

$$
16p + 1 = n^3
$$

Subtract 1 from both sides:

$$
16p = n^3 - 1
$$

Now factor the right-hand side using the **difference of cubes**:

$$
n

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning correctly rearranges the equation and identifies the need to factor $ n^3 - 1 $ using the difference of cubes, but it cuts off before completing the factorization or solving for $ p $.

[CRITIQUE]
The proposed solution starts correctly by assuming the form $ x = a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{5} $, but it fails to provide any justification or continuation for how to determine the values of $ a, b, c $, making it incomplete.

[DECISION PROMPT]
PROBLEM: You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: The number $\sqrt{104\sqrt{6}+468\sqrt{10}+144\sqrt{15}+2006}$ can be written as $a\sqrt{2}+b\sqrt{3}+c\sqrt{5},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers. Find $abc.$.
SOLUTION AND REASONING: We are given the expression:

$$
\sqrt{104\sqrt{6} + 468\sqrt{10} + 144\sqrt{15} + 2006}
$$

and we are told that it can be written in the form:

$$
a\sqrt{2} + b\sqrt{3} + c\sqrt{5}
$$

where $ a, b, c $ are positive integers. We are to find the product $ abc $.
