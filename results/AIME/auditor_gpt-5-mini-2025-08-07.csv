If $\cos \alpha$ , which is a positive rational number, is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of its numerator and denominator?.

[THOUGHT]
Step 1. For a circle of radius R, a chord subtending central angle θ has length 2R sin(θ/2). Thus
2 = 2R sin(α/2) ⇒ sin(α/2)=1/R,
3 = 2R sin(β/2) ⇒ sin(β/2)=3/(2R),
4 = 2R sin((α+β)/2) ⇒ sin((α+β)/2)=2/R.

Step 2. Let x = 1/R. Then
sin(α/2)=x, sin(β/2)=3x/2, sin((α+β)/2)=2x,
and cos(α/2)=√(1−x^2), cos(β/2)=√(1−9x^2/4).

Using the sine addition formula:
sin((α+β)/2)=sin(α/2)cos(β/2)+cos(α/2)sin(β/2),
so
2x = x·√(1−9x^2/4) + (3x/2)·√(1−x^2).

Divide both sides by x (>0): 
2 = √(1−9x^2/4) + (3/2)√(1−x^2).

Step 3. Let A = √(1−9x^2/4), B = √(1−x^2). Then A + (3/2)B = 2.
Isolate A and square:
A = 2 − (3/2)B ⇒ A^2 = 4 − 6B + (9/4)B^2.

But A^2 = 1 − 9x^2/4 and B^2 = 1 − x^2. Substitute:
1 − 9x^2/4 = 4 − 6B + (9/4)(1 − x^2).

The x^2 terms cancel, leaving:
1 − 9x^2/4 = 4 − 6B + 9/4 − (9/4)x^2
⇒ the x^2 terms cancel ⇒ 6B = 21/4 ⇒ B = 7/8.

Thus √(1−x^2) = 7/8 ⇒ 1−x^2 = 49/64 ⇒ x^2 = 15/64.

Step 4. cos α = 1 − 2 sin^2(α/2) = 1 − 2x^2 = 1 − 2(15/64) = 1 − 30/64 = 34/64 = 17/32.

In lowest terms cos α = 17/32, so numerator+denominator = 17+32 = 49.

SOLUTION: 49

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and valid — the algebra and domain checks are sound, yielding cos α = 17/32 and the requested sum 49.

1 − 9x^2/4 = 4 − 6B + 9/4 − (9/4)x^2
⇒ the x^2 terms cancel ⇒ 6B = 21/4 ⇒ B = 7/8.

Thus √(1−x^2) = 7/8 ⇒ 1−x^2 = 49/64 ⇒ x^2 = 15/64.

Step 4. cos α = 1 − 2 sin^2(α/2) = 1 − 2x^2 = 1 − 2(15/64) = 1 − 30/64 = 34/64 = 17/32.

Let r = a/b in lowest terms (a,b positive integers, gcd(a,b)=1). Write 55r in lowest terms as c/d. Since gcd(a,b)=1, gcd(55a,b)=gcd(55,b). Let g = gcd(55,b) (so g ∈ {1,5,11,55}). After reduction,
c = 55a/g and d = b/g. The condition a + b = c + d becomes
a + b = 55a/g + b/g = (55a + b)/g.

Multiply by g:
g(a + b) = 55a + b
=> ga + gb = 55a + b
=> b(g − 1) = a(55 − g).

Check possible g values:

- g = 1: b(0) = a·54 ⇒ a = 0, impossible.

- g = 5: 4b = 50a ⇒ 2b = 25a ⇒ b = 25k, a = 2k. Since gcd(a,b)=k must equal 1, k = 1. So (a,b) = (2,25), giving r = 2/25. Check gcd(55,25)=5 OK.

- g = 11: 10b = 44a ⇒ 5b = 22a ⇒ a = 5k, b = 22k. gcd = k ⇒ k = 1. So (a,b) = (5,22), giving r = 5/22. Check gcd(55,22)=11 OK.

- g = 55: 54b = 0 ⇒ b = 0, impossible.

Thus S = {2/25, 5/22}. Their sum is
2/25 + 5/22 = 44/550 + 125/550 = 169/550,

[THOUGHT]
Let the roots be r1, r2, r3 (counted with multiplicity). The polynomial is monic with integer coefficients, so complex roots occur in conjugate pairs and the elementary symmetric sums of the roots are integers.

Each root has modulus either 20 or 13. There are four possible distributions by modulus among the three roots:
(1) all three have modulus 20,
(2) all three have modulus 13,
(3) two have modulus 20 and one has modulus 13,
(4) two have modulus 13 and one has modulus 20.

Count polynomials in each case.

Case 1: all three |z| = 20.
- All three real roots: each real root must be ±20. The multisets of three elements from {20, −20} give 4 polynomials:
  (20,20,20), (20,20,−20), (20,−20,−20), (−20,−20,−20).
- One real root r = ±20 and a nonreal conjugate pair of modulus 20: write the quadratic factor as z^2 − s z + 400 where the conjugate pair has sum s = 40 cos θ. For integer coefficients we need s ∈ Z. For a nonreal pair the discriminant is negative, so |s| < 40; thus s can be any integer from −39 to 39 (79 choices). For each of the two choices r = 20 or −20 we get 79 polynomials, so 2·79 = 158 here.
Total for Case 1 = 4 + 158 = 162.

Case 2: all three |z| = 13.
- All three real: roots ±13 give 4 polynomials (analogous to Case 1).
- One real root r = ±13 and a nonreal conjugate pair of modulus 13: quadratic z^2 − t z + 169 with t = 26 cos θ ∈ Z and for nonreal pair |t| < 26, so t = −25, …, 25 (51 choices). With 2 choices for r this gives 2·51 = 102.
Total for Case 2 = 4 + 102 = 106.

Case 3: two roots |z| = 20 and one root |z| = 13.
Because nonreal roots come in conjugate pairs, the two modulus-20 roots can be the conjugate pair, and the single modulus-13 root must be real r = ±13. The quadratic for the 20-pair is z^2 − s z + 400 with s = 40 cos θ ∈ Z. Here s may be any integer satisfying |s| ≤ 40 (s = ±40 gives the double real root 20 or −20). So s ∈ {−40, …, 40} (81 choices). For each of the 2 choices r = ±13 we get 81 polynomials.
Total for Case 3 = 2·81 = 162.

Case 4: two roots |z| = 13 and one root |z| = 20.
Analogous to Case 3: quadratic z^2 − t z + 169 with t ∈ Z and |t| ≤ 26, so t ∈ {−26, …, 26} (53 choices). The lone modulus-20 root is r = ±20 (2 choices), giving 2·53 = 106 polynomials.
Total for Case 4 = 106.

Add the four cases:
162 + 106 + 162 + 106 = 536.

SOLUTION: 536

[CRITIQUE]
The argument misses cases where two roots of the same modulus are real with opposite signs (e.g. 20 and −20 or 13 and −13), so mixed triples like {20, −20, 13} and {13, −13, 20} were not counted.

We want w satisfying 1/(z+w) = 1/z + 1/w with |z| = 2014. Multiply both sides by (z+w)zw to avoid denominators:
zw = (w+z)^2.
Rearrange:
0 = (w+z)^2 − zw = w^2 + zw + z^2.
So w satisfies the quadratic
w^2 + z w + z^2 = 0.
Solve:
w = [-z ± sqrt(z^2 − 4z^2)]/2 = [-z ± z sqrt(−3)]/2 = z * (−1 ± i√3)/2.
Hence the solutions are w = z e^{2π i/3} and w = z e^{−2π i/3}. Thus the polygon P has vertices z, z e^{2π i/3}, z e^{−2π i/3} — three points on the circle of radius 2014, spaced 120° apart, i.e. an equilateral triangle centered at 0.

Side length s = |z − z e^{2π i/3}| = |z| · |1 − e^{2π i/3}| = 2014 · 2 sin(π/3) = 2014 · √3.
Area of an equilateral triangle = (√3/4) s^2 = (√3/4) · (2014^2 · 3) = (3·2014^2/4) · √3.
Since 2014 = 2·1007, 2014^2 = 4·1007^2, so n = 3·2014^2/4 = 3·1007^2.

Reflect A = (u,v) across y=x to get B=(v,u). Reflect B across the y-axis: C = (−v,u). Reflect C across the x-axis: D = (−v,−u). Reflect D across the y-axis: E = (v,−u).

Vertices in order: A(u,v), B(v,u), C(−v,u), D(−v,−u), E(v,−u).

Use the shoelace formula. Compute
sum x_i y_{i+1} − y_i x_{i+1} =
(u·u − v·v) + (v·u − u·(−v)) + ((−v)·(−u) − u·(−v)) + ((−v)·(−u) − (−u)·v) + (v·v − (−u)·u)
= (u^2 − v^2) + 2uv + 2uv + 2uv + (v^2 + u^2)

Thus area = 1/2 · (2u^2 + 6uv) = u^2 + 3uv = 451.

So u(u + 3v) = 451 = 11·41. Since 0 < v < u, u must be the smaller factor, so u = 11 and u + 3v = 41 ⇒ 3v = 30 ⇒ v = 10.

Therefore u + v = 11 + 10 = 21.

Vertices in order: A(u,v), B(v,u), C(−v,u), D(−v,−u), E(v,−u).

Let the centers of C1, C2, C3 be A, C, O respectively, with A, C, O collinear. Put A at x = 0, C at x = 14 (since the two small circles are externally tangent, AC = 4 + 10 = 14). If O is between A and C then OA + OC = AC, and since OA = R − 4 and OC = R − 10 (R is the radius of C3) we get
(R − 4) + (R − 10) = 14 ⇒ 2R − 14 = 14 ⇒ R = 14.

Place the x-axis through the three centers (so A = (0,0), C = (14,0), O = (10,0)). Let L be the common external tangent line; take the tangent above the x-axis. Write L as y = mx + b. The perpendicular distance from (x,0) to L is |b + mx|/√(1 + m^2). For A and C these distances equal their radii 4 and 10, so
b/√(1+m^2) = 4,
(b + 14m)/√(1+m^2) = 10.

Subtracting gives
14m = 6√(1+m^2) ⇒ 196 m^2 = 36(1+m^2) ⇒ 160 m^2 = 36 ⇒ m^2 = 9/40.

We need the perpendicular distance d from O = (10,0) to L:
d = (b + 10m)/√(1+m^2) = b/√(1+m^2) + 10·(m/√(1+m^2)).
We already have b/√(1+m^2) = 4, and from 14m = 6√(1+m^2) we get m/√(1+m^2) = 6/14 = 3/7. Thus
d = 4 + 10·(3/7) = 4 + 30/7 = 58/7.

The chord of C3 cut by L has length 2√(R^2 − d^2) with R = 14:
length = 2√(196 − (58/7)^2) = 2√((9604 − 3364)/49) = 2√(6240/49) = (2/7)√6240.
Factor 6240 = 16·390, so √6240 = 4√390 and the length is (2/7)·4√390 = 8√390/7.

We have
3(0 - h)^2 + j = 2013 so j = 2013 - 3h^2,
2(0 - h)^2 + k = 2014 so k = 2014 - 2h^2.

The x-intercepts of y = 3(x - h)^2 + j are solutions of 3(x - h)^2 + j = 0, so
(x - h)^2 = -j/3 = -(2013 - 3h^2)/3 = h^2 - 671.
Thus h^2 - 671 must be a positive perfect square; write h^2 - 671 = a^2, a > 0. Then
(h - a)(h + a) = 671 = 11·61.
Possible factor pairs (h - a, h + a) are (1,671) or (11,61), giving h = 336 or h = 36.

Similarly, the x-intercepts of y = 2(x - h)^2 + k satisfy
(x - h)^2 = -k/2 = -(2014 - 2h^2)/2 = h^2 - 1007.
So h^2 - 1007 = b^2 for some b > 0, giving
(h - b)(h + b) = 1007 = 19·53.
Possible factor pairs are (1,1007) or (19,53), giving h = 504 or h = 36.

The only h common to both lists is h = 36. (This indeed yields integer positive x-intercepts: for the first parabola 36 ± 25 = 61 and 11, for the second 36 ± 17 = 53 and 19.)

We are given that the last four digits of N and N^2 are the same, so
N^2 ≡ N (mod 10000).
Thus N(N − 1) ≡ 0 (mod 10000). Since 10000 = 2^4·5^4 and gcd(N, N−1)=1, for each of the prime-power factors N must be congruent to 0 or 1. So
N ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 16) and N ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 625).
This gives four CRT cases modulo 10000:

Place the centers at (1,1),(1,3),(1,5),(3,1),(3,3),(3,5),(5,1),(5,3) and take the circles to have radius 1 (the picture is scaled; using radius 1 or 1/2 only changes all areas by a constant factor and does not affect the cutting line). Let l have equation y = 3x − c (so in the requested form 3x = y + c).

For a circle with center (h,k) let s = 3h − k − c. The signed perpendicular distance from the center to l is t = −s/√10. If |t| ≥ 1 the circle lies entirely on one side of l, otherwise l cuts the circle and the area of the part above l equals
A(s) = arccos(s/√10) − (s/√10)√(1 − s^2/10)
(the formula is continuous and equals π when s ≤ −√10 and 0 when s ≥ √10).

For our eight centers the values of s are
s = 2−c, −c, −2−c, 8−c, 6−c, 4−c, 14−c, 12−c.
We want the sum of the eight corresponding A(s) to equal half the total area (half of 8π), i.e. 4π.

Note the symmetry identity A(s)+A(−s)=π for |s|<√10, which follows directly from the formula for A(s). So if the multiset of s-values for some c can be paired as ±s for the partials, each such pair contributes π.

Try c = 5. The s-values become
−3, −5, −7, 3, 1, −1, 9, 7.
Here s = −5 and −7 give full-circle contributions π each (since |s|>√10), s = 9 and 7 give zero, and the remaining four values are in ± pairs: (−3,3) and (−1,1). By the symmetry each ± pair contributes π. Thus the total area above l is
π (from s=−5) + π (from s=−7) + π (from −3 and 3) + π (from −1 and 1) = 4π,
so y = 3x − 5 bisects the region.

Writing this as 3x = y + 5 gives a = 3, b = 1, c = 5, and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9 + 1 + 25 = 35.

Let p = P(rain on Sunday | no rain on Saturday). Then P(rain on Sunday | rain on Saturday) = 2p. Using the law of total probability for Sunday:
P(Sun) = P(Sat)·P(Sun|Sat) + P(no Sat)·P(Sun|no Sat)
3/10 = (2/5)·(2p) + (3/5)·p = (4/5)p + (3/5)p = (7/5)p.
So p = (3/10)·(5/7) = 3/14, and P(Sun|Sat) = 2p = 3/7.

P(rain both days) = P(Sat)·P(Sun|Sat) = (2/5)·(3/7) = 6/35.
P(rain at least one day) = P(Sat) + P(Sun) − P(both) = 2/5 + 3/10 − 6/35

What is the smallest possible number of members of the committee?.

[THOUGHT]
Let n be the total number of committee members and v1,...,v27 the votes for the 27 candidates. No candidate can have 0 votes, because then the percentage and the number of votes would both be 0 and their difference would not be ≥1. So each vi ≥ 1 and v1+...+v27 = n.

The condition for each candidate is
vi − 100·vi/n ≥ 1.
Factor vi(1 − 100/n) ≥ 1, so
vi ≥ n/(n − 100).
Since each vi is an integer, we get
vi ≥ k := ceil( n/(n − 100) ) for every i.
Hence
n = v1+...+v27 ≥ 27k,
so n ≥ 27·ceil( n/(n − 100) ).

Because vi(1 − 100/n) ≥ 1 must be positive, we must have n > 100. For n ≤ 133 we have n/(n − 100) > 4, so ceil(n/(n − 100)) ≥ 5; then n ≥ 27·5 = 135, contradiction. Thus n ≥ 134.

Check n = 134: n/(n − 100) = 134/34 ≈ 3.941..., so k = 4 and 27k = 108 ≤ 134, so the bound is compatible. Construct an explicit vote distribution: give 26 candidates 4 votes each and the remaining candidate 30 votes. Then the totals add to 26·4 + 30 = 134, and for the candidates with 4 votes
4 − 100·4/134 = 4 − 400/134 = 136/134 > 1,
and for the candidate with 30 votes
30 − 100·30/134 = 30 − 3000/134 = 1020/134 > 1.
Thus n = 134 meets the condition.

Therefore the smallest possible number of committee members is 134.

[THOUGHT]
We place the triangle on the coordinate plane using the fact that AB = 3, BC = 4, CA = 5 is a 3-4-5 right triangle with right angle at B. Let B = (0,0), A = (3,0), C = (0,4). The circle ω passes through B and meets AB at E and B, BC at B and D, and AC at F and G. Since the circle passes through the origin, its equation may be written as
x^2 + y^2 + u x + v y = 0.
The intersections with the coordinate axes are then at B = (0,0), E = (−u,0), and D = (0,−v). Put e = −u (so E = (e,0)) and d = −v (so D = (0,d)); note 0 ≤ e ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ d ≤ 4. Thus the circle is
x^2 + y^2 − e x − d y = 0.        (1)

Observe that E = (e,0) and D = (0,d) are opposite ends of a diameter of this circle: the center is at (e/2, d/2), which is the midpoint of ED, so ED is a diameter. Hence for any point P on the circle the angle EPD is a right angle. In particular, F and G (points where the circle meets AC) both satisfy ∠EFD = 90° and ∠EGD = 90°.

Given EF = DF, the point F is equidistant from E and D, so F lies on the perpendicular bisector of ED. Thus F is the intersection of three sets: the line AC, the circle, and the perpendicular bisector of ED. Parametrize the perpendicular bisector through the center O = (e/2, d/2). A convenient description of the two intersection points of the circle with the perpendicular bisector is obtained by moving from O by ±(1/2)(d,e) (a vector perpendicular to ED scaled appropriately). Those two points are
P± = (e/2, d/2) ± (d/2, e/2) = ((e±d)/2, (d±e)/2).
The two possibilities are P+ = ((e+d)/2, (e+d)/2) and P− = ((e−d)/2, (d−e)/2).

F must be one of these; F must also lie on AC, whose line equation is y = −(4/3)x + 4. Substitute each possibility:

- For P− we get x = (e−d)/2. If that equals 12 (from solving −x = −4/3 x + 4), it would be far outside the triangle, so P− is impossible here.

- For P+ we require (e+d)/2 to satisfy the line:
(e+d)/2 = −(4/3)((e+d)/2) + 4.
Multiply by 6: 3(e+d) = −4(e+d) + 24, so 7(e+d) = 24, hence
e + d = 24/7.        (2)

So the x-coordinate of F is x_F = (e+d)/2 = 12/7.

Now use the quadratic for intersections of the circle with AC. Substituting y = −(4/3)x + 4 into (1) yields, after clearing denominators,
25 x^2 + (−96 +12 d − 9 e) x + (144 − 36 d) = 0.
Thus the two x-coordinates x_F and x_G of the intersections with AC satisfy
x_F + x_G = (96 − 12 d + 9 e)/25,     x_F x_G = (144 − 36 d)/25.        (3)

We already have x_F = (e+d)/2 = 12/7. So the other root x_G equals
x_G = (144 − 36 d)/(25 x_F) = (144 − 36 d)/(25 · (12/7)) = 21(4 − d)/25.        (4)

Now impose the condition DG/EG = 3/4. For a point G = (x_G, y_G) on the circle (and on AC), the algebraic simplification (using the circle equation) gives the useful identity
DG^2 = e x_G − d y_G + d^2,     EG^2 = − e x_G + d y_G + e^2.
Thus DG^2/EG^2 = 9/16 is equivalent (after cancellation) to
S_G := − e x_G + d y_G = (16 d^2 − 9 e^2)/25.        (5)

But y_G = −(4/3)x_G + 4, and with x_G from (4) and e = 24/7 − d (from (2)), compute S_G directly:

Compute S_G = (−e − (4/3)d) x_G + 4 d.
Substitute x_G = 21(4 − d)/25 and e = 24/7 − d to obtain after simplification
S_G = (7 d^2 + 144 d − 288)/25.

Equate this to the right side of (5):
(7 d^2 + 144 d − 288)/25 = (16 d^2 − 9 e^2)/25.
Multiply by 25 and substitute e^2 = (24/7 − d)^2; simplifying gives
d^2 − e^2 − 16 d + 32 = 0.
Using e = 24/7 − d this becomes a linear equation in d:
992 − 448 d = 0,
so
d = 992/448 = 31/14.

Then e = 24/7 − d = 48/14 − 31/14 = 17/14.

Finally DE is the distance between E = (e,0) and D = (0,d):
DE = sqrt(e^2 + d^2) = sqrt((17/14)^2 + (31/14)^2) = (1/14) sqrt(17^2 + 31^2)
= (1/14) sqrt(289 + 961) = (1/14) sqrt(1250) = (1/14) · 25 sqrt{2} = 25 sqrt{2} / 14.

So DE = (25 sqrt{2})/14, hence a = 25, b = 2, c = 14 and a + b + c = 25 + 2 + 14 = 41.

SOLUTION: 41

[CRITIQUE]
The solution is correct and complete (up to a minor descriptive typo), and it legitimately produces DE = 25√2/14 so a + b + c = 41.

e + d = 24/7.        (2)

So the x-coordinate of F is x_F = (e+d)/2 = 12/7.

Now impose the condition DG/EG = 3/4. For a point G = (x_G, y_G) on the circle (and on AC), the algebraic simplification (using the circle equation) gives the useful identity
DG^2 = e x_G − d y_G + d^2,     EG^2 = − e x_G + d y_G + e^2.
Thus DG^2/EG^2 = 9/16 is equivalent (after cancellation) to
S_G := − e x_G + d y_G = (16 d^2 − 9 e^2)/25.        (5)

But y_G = −(4/3)x_G + 4, and with x_G from (4) and e = 24/7 − d (from (2)), compute S_G directly:

Compute S_G = (−e − (4/3)d) x_G + 4 d.
Substitute x_G = 21(4 − d)/25 and e = 24/7 − d to obtain after simplification
S_G = (7 d^2 + 144 d − 288)/25.

Equate this to the right side of (5):
(7 d^2 + 144 d − 288)/25 = (16 d^2 − 9 e^2)/25.
Multiply by 25 and substitute e^2 = (24/7 − d)^2; simplifying gives
d^2 − e^2 − 16 d + 32 = 0.
Using e = 24/7 − d this becomes a linear equation in d:
992 − 448 d = 0,
so
d = 992/448 = 31/14.

Then e = 24/7 − d = 48/14 − 31/14 = 17/14.

Finally DE is the distance between E = (e,0) and D = (0,d):
DE = sqrt(e^2 + d^2) = sqrt((17/14)^2 + (31/14)^2) = (1/14) sqrt(17^2 + 31^2)
= (1/14) sqrt(289 + 961) = (1/14) sqrt(1250) = (1/14) · 25 sqrt{2} = 25 sqrt{2} / 14.

So DE = (25 sqrt{2})/14, hence a = 25, b = 2, c = 14 and a + b + c = 25 + 2 + 14 = 41.

SOLUTION: 41","The solution is correct and complete (up to a minor descriptive typo), and it legitimately produces DE = 25√2/14 so a + b + c = 41.",2026-02-21 16:46:22

Find $m + n$ ..

[THOUGHT]
We are given xyz = 1, x + 1/z = 5, and y + 1/x = 29. From xyz = 1 we get 1/z = xy. Substitute 1/z = xy into x + 1/z = 5 to obtain
x + xy = x(1 + y) = 5,
so x = 5/(1 + y).

Substitute this x into y + 1/x = 29:
y + 1/x = y + (1 + y)/5 = 29.
Multiply both sides by 5:
5y + 1 + y = 145 ⇒ 6y + 1 = 145 ⇒ 6y = 144 ⇒ y = 24.

Then x = 5/(1 + 24) = 5/25 = 1/5. From xyz = 1 we get z = 1/(xy) = 1/((1/5)·24) = 5/24.

Now compute z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4, so m/n = 1/4 and m + n = 1 + 4 = 5.

SOLUTION: 5

[THOUGHT]
Step 1 — Monday: probability the two socks are different colors.
Total ways to pick 2 from 10 is C(10,2)=45. There are 5 matching pairs, so
P(Monday non-match) = 1 − 5/45 = 40/45 = 8/9.

Step 2 — Tuesday given Monday was non-match.
If Monday removed two different colors, then among the remaining 8 socks there are 3 full pairs left, so
P(Tuesday match | Monday non-match) = 3/C(8,2) = 3/28,
hence P(Tuesday non-match | Monday non-match) = 1 − 3/28 = 25/28.

So after two non-matching days the probability so far is (8/9)(25/28) = 50/63 that no match has yet occurred.

Step 3 — Wednesday given the first two days were non-match.
Condition on the ordered 4 socks drawn in the first two days (positions 1–4). Among sequences that have no intra-day matches there are three possible color-count patterns in the first four socks:
- (1,1,1,1): four different colors (probability 1920/4000 = 12/25),
- (2,1,1): one color appears twice and two others once (probability 1920/4000 = 12/25),
- (2,2): two colors each appear twice (probability 160/4000 = 1/25).

Given these patterns, the number k of full pairs remaining among the 6 socks before Wednesday is 1, 2, 3 respectively, so
P(Wednesday match | pattern) = k / C(6,2) = k/15.

Thus
P(Wednesday match | first two days non-match)
= (12/25)(1/15) + (12/25)(2/15) + (1/25)(3/15)
= (12+24+3)/375 = 39/375 = 13/125.

Step 4 — Multiply the pieces.
Total probability = (8/9)·(25/28)·(13/125) = 26/315.

So m+n = 26 + 315 = 341.

SOLUTION: 341

[CRITIQUE]
Step 3 uses unexplained and inconsistent counts (the 1920/4000 and 160/4000 figures) to assign pattern probabilities, so those pattern probabilities are unjustified even though the final numerical result is correct.

[THOUGHT]
Let the area of triangle ABC be S. Put barycentric coordinates for P with respect to ABC: let the (normalized) weights at A, B, C be x, y, z, so x + y + z = 1 and x, y, z > 0.

When we draw through P the three lines parallel to the sides of ABC, the three small triangles that meet at P are similar to ABC. The linear similarity ratio of the small triangle corresponding to vertex A is x (because its side lengths are x times the corresponding side lengths of ABC), so its area is x^2 S. Similarly the other two small triangles that meet at P have areas y^2 S and z^2 S.

Thus, if those three areas are given as 4, 9, and 49, we have
x^2 S = 4, y^2 S = 9, z^2 S = 49.

Taking square roots and adding,
x sqrt(S) + y sqrt(S) + z sqrt(S) = 2 + 3 + 7 = 12.

But x + y + z = 1, so (x + y + z) sqrt(S) = sqrt(S) = 12. Hence sqrt(S) = 12, so S = 144.

SOLUTION: 144

[CRITIQUE]
The flaw is the claim that the barycentric weight x is a linear similarity ratio: in fact x=[PBC]/[ABC] is an area fraction (not a side-length ratio), so you cannot conclude the small triangle's area equals x^2S from x alone.

[THOUGHT]
We have
N = sum_{k=1}^{1000} k ( ceil(log_{√2} k) − floor(log_{√2} k) ).

For any real x, ceil(x) − floor(x) = 0 if x is an integer, and = 1 if x is not an integer. Thus the factor equals 0 exactly when log_{√2} k is an integer, and equals 1 otherwise. Therefore
N = sum_{k=1}^{1000} k − sum_{k: log_{√2} k ∈ Z} k.

Solve log_{√2} k = m ∈ Z ⇔ k = (√2)^m = 2^{m/2}. This is an integer exactly when m is even, i.e. k = 2^t for some integer t ≥ 0. The powers of 2 ≤ 1000 are 2^0,2^1,...,2^9 = 1,2,4,...,512 (2^10 = 1024 > 1000). So there are 10 such k.

Compute the sums:
sum_{k=1}^{1000} k = 1000·1001/2 = 500500.
sum_{t=0}^{9} 2^t = 2^{10} − 1 = 1023.

Hence N = 500500 − 1023 = 499477. The remainder of 499477 modulo 1000 is 477.

SOLUTION: 477

[CRITIQUE]
Correct — the only k with integer log_{√2}k are powers of 2, so N = 500500 − (1+2+⋯+512)=500500−1023=499477 and the remainder mod 1000 is 477.

0","We have
N = sum_{k=1}^{1000} k ( ceil(log_{√2} k) − floor(log_{√2} k) ).

For any real x, ceil(x) − floor(x) = 0 if x is an integer, and = 1 if x is not an integer. Thus the factor equals 0 exactly when log_{√2} k is an integer, and equals 1 otherwise. Therefore
N = sum_{k=1}^{1000} k − sum_{k: log_{√2} k ∈ Z} k.

Solve log_{√2} k = m ∈ Z ⇔ k = (√2)^m = 2^{m/2}. This is an integer exactly when m is even, i.e. k = 2^t for some integer t ≥ 0. The powers of 2 ≤ 1000 are 2^0,2^1,...,2^9 = 1,2,4,...,512 (2^10 = 1024 > 1000). So there are 10 such k.

[THOUGHT]
Place the trapezoid with CD on the x-axis and AB parallel to it. Let A = (0,h), B = (s,h) with s = AB, and let D = (x,0), C = (x+L,0) with L = CD. Since AD = BC and AB < CD, the top and bottom bases have the same midpoint, so
x = (s - L)/2, C = ((s+L)/2,0), D = ((s-L)/2,0).

The distance from A to the base CD is the height h, so h = 18.

Compute the distance from A to line BC. Vector BC = ((L - s)/2, -h). Vector BA = A - B = (-s,0). The area (magnitude of cross product) of BA and BC is |h s|, so
dist(A, BC) = h s / sqrt(((L - s)/2)^2 + h^2) = 15.

Similarly for BD: vector BD = (-(s+L)/2, -h), and the cross product with BA again has magnitude h s, so
dist(A, BD) = h s / sqrt(((s + L)/2)^2 + h^2) = 10.

Set a = (L - s)/2 and b = (s + L)/2 = a + s. Then with h = 18 we have
(1) 18 s / sqrt(a^2 + 18^2) = 15
(2) 18 s / sqrt(b^2 + 18^2) = 10.

From (1)/(2) we get sqrt(b^2 + 324) / sqrt(a^2 + 324) = 3/2, so (b^2 + 324)/(a^2 + 324) = 9/4.
Solving the algebraic system (equivalently eliminating s^2) leads to the linear relation a = (2/5) s. (You can verify by substituting a = t s and solving for t.)

With a = (2/5) s, compute s^2 from (1):
18^2 s^2 = 225(a^2 + 324) = 225((4/25) s^2 + 324),
so 324 s^2 = 225*(4/25) s^2 + 225*324 = 36 s^2 + 72900,
hence 288 s^2 = 72900, so s^2 = 72900/288 = 2025/8, and s = 45/(2√2).

Now L = s + 2a = s + 2*(2/5)s = s*(1 + 4/5) = (9/5) s, so the sum of bases is s + L = (14/5) s. The area K of the trapezoid is
K = ( (AB + CD)/2 ) * h = ((s+L)/2) * 18 = (7 s /5) * 18 = (126/5) s.

Compute K explicitly: s = 45/(2√2) so
K = (126/5) * 45/(2√2) = (126*45)/(10√2) = (567)/(√2).

Therefore √2 * K = 567.

Correct and complete — the geometric setup and algebra are valid, and they correctly obtain √2·K = 567.

[THOUGHT]
We are given a1,a2,a3 ∈ {1,...,10} and the recurrence
a_n = a_{n-1} · |a_{n-2} − a_{n-3}| for n ≥ 4.
A term a_n becomes 0 exactly when some factor |a_{k+1} − a_k| = 0 occurs (because if |a_{k+1}−a_k| = 0 then a_{k+3} = a_{k+2}·0 = 0), and once 0 appears it persists. So the sequence hits 0 iff some pair of consecutive terms are equal at some point. Equivalently, if any difference b_j := |a_j − a_{j+1}| ever equals 0. But b_j = a_j · |b_{j-2} − 1| (because a_{j+1} = a_j·b_{j-2}), so a zero b_j can arise only if some previous b_{j-2} = 1. Hence a sequence hits 0 iff some b_k equals 0 or 1 at some stage.

The initial differences are
b1 = |a1 − a2|, b2 = |a2 − a3|, and
b3 = |a3 − a4| = a3·(b1 − 1) (since a4 = a3·b1).

Thus the only ways a b_j can equal 0 or 1 are:
- b1 = 0 or 1 (i.e. a1 = a2 or |a1 − a2| = 1),
- b2 = 0 or 1 (i.e. a2 = a3 or |a2 − a3| = 1),
- b3 = 1, which occurs exactly when a3 = 1 and b1 = 2 (i.e. a3 = 1 and |a2 − a1| = 2).

(For j ≥ 4, b_j is a product of factors ≥ 2 except in the b3 special case above, so no new 1’s or 0’s can appear later.)

Therefore a triple (a1,a2,a3) leads to a zero term iff it satisfies at least one of:
(1) a1 = a2; (2) |a1 − a2| = 1; (3) a2 = a3; (4) |a2 − a3| = 1; (5) a3 = 1 and |a2 − a1| = 2.

It is simpler to count the complement: triples that avoid all these conditions. Such a triple must have
|a1 − a2| ≥ 2 and |a2 − a3| ≥ 2, and also not (a3 = 1 and |a2 − a1| = 2).

For a fixed middle value t = a2, the number of a1 with |a1 − t| ≥ 2 is
g(t) = 8 when t ∈ {1,10}, and g(t) = 7 when t ∈ {2,...,9}.
Similarly for a3. So the number of triples with |a1 − a2| ≥ 2 and |a2 − a3| ≥ 2 is
S' = Σ_{t=1}^{10} g(t)^2 = 2·8^2 + 8·7^2 = 128 + 392 = 520.

Among these 520 triples there are some with a3 = 1 and |a2 − a1| = 2; these were counted in S' but they do produce a 1 at b3 and hence lead to 0, so they must be removed from the complement. Count those: a3 = 1 and |a2 − a1| = 2, with the additional requirement |a2 − a3| ≥ 2 (otherwise they were not in S'). That forces a2 ≥ 3, and for a2 = 3..8 there are 2 choices of a1 (a2±2), for a2 = 9,10 there is 1 choice each. So there are 14 such triples. Thus the number of triples that never produce a 0 is
S = S' − 14 = 520 − 14 = 506.

Total number of triples is 10^3 = 1000, so the number of sequences that do hit 0 is
1000 − 506 = 494.

SOLUTION: 494

[CRITIQUE]
The argument's crucial claim that ""for j ≥ 4 no new 0’s or 1’s can appear"" is not properly justified — it omits a proof that under the assumed complement conditions a_j cannot equal 1 (and |b_{j-2}−1| cannot be 1), so possible later occurrences of b_j=1 (and hence 0) are not rigorously excluded.

We first determine where a card numbered k (originally at position k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n) ends up after the restacking.

Label the top n cards (1 through n) as pile A in order A1 = 1, A2 = 2, …, An = n, and the remaining cards (n+1 through 2n) as pile B in order B1 = n+1, B2 = n+2, …, Bn = 2n. Cards are taken alternately from the tops of B and A and placed onto a new pile; the first card taken (B1 = n+1) becomes the bottom of the new stack, the last taken (An = n) becomes the top. If p_j denotes the j-th card taken, then

- p_{2m-1} = n + m (the m-th card from B),
- p_{2m}     = m     (the m-th card from A),

for m = 1,…,n. The final position (top = 1, bottom = 2n) of p_j is 2n − j + 1.

Thus for a card k:

- If 1 ≤ k ≤ n (k is in A, k = m), it is taken at j = 2k, so its new position is
  newpos = 2n − 2k + 1.

- If n+1 ≤ k ≤ 2n (k is in B, k = n + m), it is taken at j = 2m − 1 with m = k − n, so its new position is
  newpos = 2n − (2m − 1) + 1 = 2n − 2m + 2 = 4n − 2k + 2.

We want card k = 131 to remain in the same position (newpos = 131), and the final stack must be magical (at least one card from each pile fixed).

Case A: 131 ≤ n (card 131 is in A).
Set 2n − 2·131 + 1 = 131 → 2n − 262 + 1 = 131 → 2n − 261 = 131 → 2n = 392 → n = 196.
Check B: a B-card is fixed when 4n − 2k + 2 = k → 3k = 4n + 2 → k = (4n + 2)/3.
For n = 196 this gives k = (784 + 2)/3 = 786/3 = 262, which lies in B (197..392). So both piles have at least one fixed card (131 in A, 262 in B). The stack is magical, with total cards 2n = 392.

Case B: 131 ≥ n+1 (card 131 is in B).
Set 4n − 2·131 + 2 = 131 → 4n + 2 = 3·131 = 393 → 4n = 391 → n = 97.75, not an integer. So no solution in this case.

Therefore the only possible total number of cards that satisfies the conditions is 392.

SOLUTION: 392

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete: the only integer solution is n = 196, which fixes card 131 (in A) and also fixes card 262 (in B), so the unique magical stack size is 2n = 392.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the least positive integer $n$ for which $2^n + 5^n - n$ is a multiple of $1000$ ..

[THOUGHT]
We want the least positive integer n with 2^n + 5^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 1000). Since 1000 = 8·125, solve the congruences modulo 8 and modulo 125 and combine by CRT.

1) Modulo 8.
For n ≥ 3, 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 8). Also 5^n ≡ 5 (if n odd) and ≡ 1 (if n even) (mod 8). Thus for n ≥ 3:
2^n + 5^n − n ≡ 0 + 5^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 8).
If n is even this gives 1 − n ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ n ≡ 1 (mod 8) which is impossible for even n. So n must be odd and
5 − n ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ n ≡ 5 (mod 8).

So any solution n ≥ 3 must be odd and n ≡ 5 (mod 8).

2) Modulo 125.
For n ≥ 3 we have 5^n ≡ 0 (mod 125), so the condition becomes
2^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 125), i.e. 2^n ≡ n (mod 125).

Because 2 has order dividing 100 modulo 125, 2^n (mod 125) depends only on s = n (mod 100). Write n = s + 100m with 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. Then
2^n ≡ 2^s (mod 125), so the congruence becomes
s + 100m ≡ 2^s (mod 125),
or 100m ≡ 2^s − s (mod 125). Since gcd(100,125)=25, a necessary condition is
2^s − s ≡ 0 (mod 25), i.e. s ≡ 2^s (mod 25).

Find s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) with s ≡ 2^s (mod 25). Let k = s (mod 20), and a_k = 2^k (mod 25) (2^k mod 25 has period 20). A solution s must satisfy s ≡ k (mod 20) and s ≡ a_k (mod 25); such an s (mod 100) exists iff k ≡ a_k (mod 5). Checking k = 0,…,19 yields valid k = 3, 14, 16, 17, giving corresponding s (mod 100) equal to
k=3 → s=83,
k=14 → s=34,
k=16 → s=36,
k=17 → s=97.

So the s in 0..99 satisfying s ≡ 2^s (mod 25) are 34, 36, 83, 97.

3) Compatibility with the modulo-8 condition.
We need n ≡ 5 (mod 8). Since n = s + 100m, reduce modulo 8:
s + 100m ≡ 5 (mod 8). Because 100 ≡ 4 (mod 8), this is
s + 4m ≡ 5 (mod 8), i.e. 4m ≡ 5 − s (mod 8).
This congruence is solvable iff 5 − s ≡ 0 (mod 4), i.e. s ≡ 1 (mod 4). From our s-candidates, only s = 97 satisfies s ≡ 1 (mod 4). So s = 97 is the only viable choice.

4) Solve for m.
For s = 97 compute 2^s (mod 125). From the powers of 2 modulo 125 (period 100) we have 2^97 ≡ 47 (mod 125). Then
100m ≡ 2^s − s ≡ 47 − 97 ≡ −50 ≡ 75 (mod 125).
Divide by 25: 4m ≡ 3 (mod 5) ⇒ m ≡ 4·3 ≡ 12 ≡ 2 (mod 5).

Also from the mod 8 condition: 4m ≡ 5 − s = 5 − 97 = −92 ≡ 4 (mod 8), dividing by 4 (valid because gcd(4,8)=4 and 4 divides RHS) gives m ≡ 1 (mod 2).

Thus m ≡ 2 (mod 5) and m ≡ 1 (mod 2). Solving mod 10 gives m ≡ 7 (mod 10). The smallest nonnegative m with that property is m = 7.

So the least positive n with s = 97 and m = 7 is
n = s + 100m = 97 + 700 = 797.

5) Verify:
- Mod 8: 797 ≡ 5 (mod 8) so 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 8).
- Mod 125: 2^797 ≡ 2^{797 mod 100} = 2^97 ≡ 47 (mod 125), and 797 ≡ 47 (mod 125), so 2^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 125). Hence 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 125).
Therefore 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 1000) by CRT.

SOLUTION: 797

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete, so the conclusion that the least positive integer n satisfying 2^n + 5^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 1000) is n = 797 is valid.

0","We want the least positive integer n with 2^n + 5^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 1000). Since 1000 = 8·125, solve the congruences modulo 8 and modulo 125 and combine by CRT.

1) Modulo 8.
For n ≥ 3, 2^n ≡ 0 (mod 8). Also 5^n ≡ 5 (if n odd) and ≡ 1 (if n even) (mod 8). Thus for n ≥ 3:
2^n + 5^n − n ≡ 0 + 5^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 8).
If n is even this gives 1 − n ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ n ≡ 1 (mod 8) which is impossible for even n. So n must be odd and
5 − n ≡ 0 (mod 8) ⇒ n ≡ 5 (mod 8).

So any solution n ≥ 3 must be odd and n ≡ 5 (mod 8).

2) Modulo 125.
For n ≥ 3 we have 5^n ≡ 0 (mod 125), so the condition becomes
2^n − n ≡ 0 (mod 125), i.e. 2^n ≡ n (mod 125).

Because 2 has order dividing 100 modulo 125, 2^n (mod 125) depends only on s = n (mod 100). Write n = s + 100m with 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. Then
2^n ≡ 2^s (mod 125), so the congruence becomes
s + 100m ≡ 2^s (mod 125),
or 100m ≡ 2^s − s (mod 125). Since gcd(100,125)=25, a necessary condition is
2^s − s ≡ 0 (mod 25), i.e. s ≡ 2^s (mod 25).

Find s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) with s ≡ 2^s (mod 25). Let k = s (mod 20), and a_k = 2^k (mod 25) (2^k mod 25 has period 20). A solution s must satisfy s ≡ k (mod 20) and s ≡ a_k (mod 25); such an s (mod 100) exists iff k ≡ a_k (mod 5). Checking k = 0,…,19 yields valid k = 3, 14, 16, 17, giving corresponding s (mod 100) equal to
k=3 → s=83,
k=14 → s=34,
k=16 → s=36,
k=17 → s=97.

So the s in 0..99 satisfying s ≡ 2^s (mod 25) are 34, 36, 83, 97.

3) Compatibility with the modulo-8 condition.
We need n ≡ 5 (mod 8). Since n = s + 100m, reduce modulo 8:
s + 100m ≡ 5 (mod 8). Because 100 ≡ 4 (mod 8), this is
s + 4m ≡ 5 (mod 8), i.e. 4m ≡ 5 − s (mod 8).
This congruence is solvable iff 5 − s ≡ 0 (mod 4), i.e. s ≡ 1 (mod 4). From our s-candidates, only s = 97 satisfies s ≡ 1 (mod 4). So s = 97 is the only viable choice.

4) Solve for m.
For s = 97 compute 2^s (mod 125). From the powers of 2 modulo 125 (period 100) we have 2^97 ≡ 47 (mod 125). Then
100m ≡ 2^s − s ≡ 47 − 97 ≡ −50 ≡ 75 (mod 125).
Divide by 25: 4m ≡ 3 (mod 5) ⇒ m ≡ 4·3 ≡ 12 ≡ 2 (mod 5).

Also from the mod 8 condition: 4m ≡ 5 − s = 5 − 97 = −92 ≡ 4 (mod 8), dividing by 4 (valid because gcd(4,8)=4 and 4 divides RHS) gives m ≡ 1 (mod 2).

Thus m ≡ 2 (mod 5) and m ≡ 1 (mod 2). Solving mod 10 gives m ≡ 7 (mod 10). The smallest nonnegative m with that property is m = 7.

So the least positive n with s = 97 and m = 7 is
n = s + 100m = 97 + 700 = 797.

5) Verify:
- Mod 8: 797 ≡ 5 (mod 8) so 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 8).
- Mod 125: 2^797 ≡ 2^{797 mod 100} = 2^97 ≡ 47 (mod 125), and 797 ≡ 47 (mod 125), so 2^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 125). Hence 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 125).
Therefore 2^797 + 5^797 − 797 ≡ 0 (mod 1000) by CRT.

[THOUGHT]
Let Z(m) be the number of trailing zeros of m!, so
Z(m) = floor(m/5) + floor(m/25) + floor(m/125) + ... .

1) Blocks of length 5. Write m = 5k + r with 0 ≤ r ≤ 4. Then for each t ≥ 1,
floor((5k+r)/5^t) = floor(k/5^{t-1}) when r ≤ 4, so
Z(5k+r) = k + Z(k) for r = 0,1,2,3,4.
Hence Z is constant on each block 5k,5k+1,5k+2,5k+3,5k+4. Therefore for any n, the equation Z(m)=n has either 0 or exactly 5 solutions (a whole block).

2) Counting attainable positive n ≤ 1991. Each attained positive n corresponds to one whole block 5k..5k+4 whose common value is k + Z(k). So the attained positive n ≤ 1991 are exactly the values k + Z(k) with k ≥ 1 and k + Z(k) ≤ 1991. The number of such n equals the number of k ≥ 1 with k + Z(k) ≤ 1991, which is the largest k satisfying that.

Find the minimal k with k + Z(k) ≥ 1992. Compute Z(1596):
floor(1596/5)=319, floor(1596/25)=63, floor(1596/125)=12, floor(1596/625)=2, higher terms 0.
So Z(1596)=319+63+12+2=396, hence 1596 + Z(1596) = 1596 + 396 = 1992.
Thus the smallest k with k + Z(k) ≥ 1992 is k = 1596, so the largest k with k + Z(k) ≤ 1991 is 1595. Therefore there are 1595 attainable positive integers ≤ 1991.

3) Conclusion. Among the integers 1,2,...,1991 there are 1595 that are factorial tails, so the number that are not factorial tails is
1991 − 1595 = 396.

SOLUTION: 396

The argument omits a justification that the sequence a_k = k + Z(k) is strictly increasing (hence distinct), which is needed to ensure each attainable n corresponds to exactly one k and validate the counting step.

Set up coordinates. Put A = (0,0), B = (252,0) so AB = AU + UB = 84 + 168 = 252 and the semicircle has center O = (126,0) and radius R = 126. The rectangle ABCD has D = (0,−h) and DA = h (we must find h).

The line ℓ meets AB at U = (84,0) and meets the semicircle at N. Because AN = 126 = R, both A and N lie on the circle centered at O of radius 126; solving
(x − 126)^2 + y^2 = 126^2 and x^2 + y^2 = 126^2
gives xN = 63 and yN = 63√3, so N = (63,63√3). The slope of ℓ is
m = (0 − 63√3)/(84 − 63) = −63√3/21 = −3√3,
so the equation of ℓ is y = −3√3(x − 84).

Find the area of the semicircle below the line (the left semicircular piece). For x in [0,63] the line lies above the semicircular arc, so the entire vertical slice of the semicircle is below ℓ; for x in [63,84] the part below ℓ is from y = 0 up to y = line; for x ≥ 84 the line is nonpositive so there is no contribution below ℓ. Thus the semicircular area below ℓ is
S_sem,b = ∫_{0}^{63} sqrt(R^2 − (x − 126)^2) dx + ∫_{63}^{84} (−3√3(x − 84)) dx.

Compute the integrals. With R = 126,
∫ sqrt(R^2 − (x − 126)^2) dx = (u/2) sqrt(R^2 − u^2) + (R^2/2) arcsin(u/R) (u = x − 126),
so
∫_{0}^{63} sqrt(R^2 − (x − 126)^2) dx = 2646π − (3969√3)/2.
And
∫_{63}^{84} (−3√3(x − 84)) dx = (1323√3)/2.
Hence
S_sem,b = (2646π − (3969√3)/2) + (1323√3)/2 = 2646π − 1323√3.

The total semicircle area is S_sem = (1/2)πR^2 = 7938π. The rectangle area is 252h.

Line ℓ meets CD (y = −h) at
−3√3(x_T − 84) = −h ⇒ x_T = 84 + h/(3√3).
The area of the rectangle to the left of ℓ is the trapezoid with top width 84 and bottom width x_T, so
S_rect,left = (84 + x_T)/2 · h = 84h + h^2/(6√3).

The semicircular piece below ℓ and this left trapezoid together form one part of R; the whole region R has area S_sem + 252h. We are told ℓ divides R into two regions in ratio 1:2, so the smaller part has one third of the total area. The left part is the smaller one, so
S_sem,b + S_rect,left = (S_sem + 252h)/3.

Substitute S_sem,b = 2646π − 1323√3 and S_sem = 7938π; simplifying gives
(2646π − 1323√3) + (84h + h^2/(6√3)) = (7938π + 252h)/3
⇒ 84h + h^2/(6√3) + 2646π − 1323√3 = 2646π + 84h
⇒ h^2/(6√3) = 1323√3.

Thus
h^2 = 1323√3 · 6√3 = 1323 · 18 = 23814 = (63^2)·6,
so h = 63√6. Therefore DA = 63√6, with m = 63 and n = 6, and m + n = 69.

Let P(k heads) = C(8,k) p^k (1-p)^{8-k}. The condition is
C(8,3) p^3 (1-p)^5 = (1/25) C(8,5) p^5 (1-p)^3.
Since C(8,3)=C(8,5)=56, they cancel, leaving
p^3 (1-p)^5 = (1/25) p^5 (1-p)^3.
Multiply both sides by 25 and divide by p^3(1-p)^3 (valid since 0<p<1):
25(1-p)^2 = p^2.
So 25(1 - 2p + p^2) = p^2, i.e.
24 p^2 - 50 p + 25 = 0.
Solve: p = (50 ± √100)/48 = (50 ± 10)/48. The root in (0,1) is p = 40/48 = 5/6.
Thus m + n = 5 + 6 = 11.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the integer that is closest to $1000\sum_{n=3}^{10000}\frac1{n^2-4}$ ..

[THOUGHT]
We use partial fractions to telescope the sum.

1/(n^2 - 4) = 1/((n-2)(n+2)) = (1/4)(1/(n-2) - 1/(n+2)).

So
sum_{n=3}^{10000} 1/(n^2-4) = (1/4) sum_{n=3}^{10000} (1/(n-2) - 1/(n+2)).
The sum telescopes. The positive terms give 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 up to 1/(10000-2), and the negative terms cancel except for the last four: 1/(9999)+1/10000+1/10001+1/10002. Hence
sum_{n=3}^{10000} 1/(n^2-4) = (1/4)(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 - (1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002)).
Now multiply by 1000:
1000 * sum = 250*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) - 250*(1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002).

Compute the first piece exactly: 250*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4) = 250*(25/12) = 3125/6 ≈ 520.8333333333.

The small correction is 250*(1/9999 + 1/10000 + 1/10001 + 1/10002) ≈ 0.0999950015, so
1000 * sum ≈ 520.8333333333 - 0.0999950015 ≈ 520.7333383318.

(For a quick bound: 250*(4/10002) < correction < 250*(4/9999), so the value lies between about 520.73332333 and 520.73335333, well inside one unit of 521.)

Therefore the integer closest to 1000 * sum_{n=3}^{10000} 1/(n^2-4) is 521.

SOLUTION: 521

Let k = ⌊x⌋. Then x ∈ [k,k+1) and the equation x^{⌊x⌋} = N becomes x^k = N with x ∈ [k,k+1). Thus for integer k ≥ 1 the possible N satisfy
k^k ≤ N < (k+1)^k,
and for k = 0 (i.e. x ∈ (0,1)) we have x^0 = 1 so N = 1.

We only need N < 1000, so check k = 0,1,2,3,4 (for k ≥ 5 the minimum k^k ≥ 5^5 = 3125 > 1000).

- k = 0: N = 1 (count 1).
- k = 1: x ∈ [1,2) gives 1 ≤ x < 2 so x^1 ∈ [1,2) → integer N = 1 only (already counted).
- k = 2: 2^2 = 4 and 3^2 = 9, so N ∈ {4,5,6,7,8} (5 values).

Step 1 — Describe the region.
|8 − x| + y ≤ 10 is y ≤ 10 − |8 − x|, which is the ""V"" with two linear pieces:
- for x ≤ 8: y = x + 2,
- for x ≥ 8: y = 18 − x.
The second inequality 3y − x ≥ 15 is y ≥ (x + 15)/3. The region R is the set of points between y = (x + 15)/3 (lower boundary) and the V (upper boundary). The intersections of the line 3y − x = 15 with the two arms of the V give the three vertices of R.

Step 2 — Find the vertices.
Intersect with left arm y = x + 2:
3(x + 2) − x = 15 → 2x = 9 → x = 9/2, y = 13/2. Call this A = (9/2,13/2).

Intersect with right arm y = 18 − x:
3(18 − x) − x = 15 → 54 − 4x = 15 → x = 39/4, y = 33/4. Call this B = (39/4,33/4).

The apex C of the V is (8,10). Thus R is the triangle with vertices A, C, B.

Step 3 — Area of the triangle.
Use the shoelace formula (or triangle area formula). Computing gives
Area A = 49/8.

Step 4 — Centroid of the triangle.
Centroid (x̄,ȳ) is the average of the vertices:
x̄ = (9/2 + 8 + 39/4)/3 = 89/12, ȳ = (13/2 + 10 + 33/4)/3 = 33/4.

Step 5 — Distance from the centroid to the axis 3y − x = 15.
Write the line as −x + 3y − 15 = 0. Distance
d = (−x̄ + 3ȳ − 15)/√(1^2 + (−3)^2) = (3ȳ − x̄ − 15)/√10.
Compute numerator: 3(33/4) − 89/12 − 15 = 7/3, so d = 7/(3√10).

Step 6 — Volume by Pappus.
Pappus: volume = (area) × (distance traveled by centroid) = A × (2πd).
So
V = 2π · d · A = 2π · (7/(3√10)) · (49/8) = (343π)/(12√10).

2) b + c - bc = S,
3) a + c - ac = 0.

From (3): ac - a - c = 0 ⇒ (a-1)(c-1)=1 ⇒ c = a/(a-1) (a ≠ 1).

From (1): b(1 - a) = S - a ⇒ b = (a - S)/(a - 1).
From (2): b(1 - c) = S - c ⇒ b = (c - S)/(c - 1).
With c = a/(a - 1) we get c - 1 = 1/(a - 1) and hence
b = (c - S)/(c - 1) = (1 - S)a + S.

Equate the two expressions for b:
(a - S)/(a - 1) = (1 - S)a + S.
Clearing and simplifying yields (1 - S)a(a - 2) = 0.
Since 1 - S = log10 2 ≠ 0, we have a = 0 or a = 2.

Case a = 0: c = 0, b = S = 1 - log10 2, so y = 10^b = 10^{1 - log10 2} = 10/2 = 5.

0","We want the smallest positive integer divisible by 17 whose digits sum to 17.

1. Two-digit possibilities with digit-sum 17 are 89 and 98. Neither is divisible by 17 (17·5 = 85, 17·6 = 102), so no two-digit solution.

2. The smallest three-digit number with digit-sum 17 is 179 (hundreds digit minimal 1, then make the units as large as possible: 1+7+9 = 17). Check multiples of 17 from there upward:
- 17·11 = 187 (digit sum 1+8+7 = 16)

Number the chairs 1 to 15 clockwise. If a person sits in chair i, the person immediately to their left sits in chair i+1 (mod 15). The rules forbid any left→right adjacent pair equal to (E,M), (M,V), or (V,E). Equivalently, going clockwise from seat i to i+1, the ordered pair (species at i, species at i+1) cannot be (M,E), (V,M), or (E,V). Thus each step clockwise either keeps the same species or advances one step in the cycle M → V → E → M. Put numerically, if we identify M, V, E with 0,1,2 (mod 3), then each step adds 0 or 1 (mod 3).

Because seat 1 is a Martian (M) and seat 15 is an Earthling (E), the sequence around the table must start with an M-block and end with an E-block. The species therefore occur in blocks in the cyclic order M, V, E, M, V, E, ...; if there are k changes of species around the whole circle, then k must be a multiple of 3, say k = 3t, and there are exactly t M-blocks, t V-blocks, and t E-blocks. Each species has total count 5, so for a fixed t the sizes of the t M-blocks are a composition of 5 into t positive parts, and likewise for V and E.

The number of compositions of 5 into t positive parts is C(5−1, t−1) = C(4, t−1). Thus for a given t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5) the number of species-seat assignments is [C(4, t−1)]^3. Summing over t = 1,2,3,4,5 gives

N = C(4,0)^3 + C(4,1)^3 + C(4,2)^3 + C(4,3)^3 + C(4,4)^3
  = 1^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 4^3 + 1^3
  = 1 + 64 + 216 + 64 + 1
  = 346.

SOLUTION: 346

[CRITIQUE]
Correct — the argument is sound: allowed steps are 0 or +1 (mod 3) so changes come in multiples of three giving t M-, V-, and E-blocks, the block sizes are independent compositions of 5 into t positive parts counted by C(4,t−1), and summing their cubes yields N = 346.

Step 1. Rewrite with a square root variable.
Let S(x) = 1 + x + x^2 + … + x^{17}. Then P(x) = S(x)^2 − x^{17}. Put x = t^2 (so t = x^{1/2}). Then
S(x) = 1 + t^2 + t^4 + … + t^{34} = (1 − t^{36})/(1 − t^2)
and the equation P(x) = 0 becomes
((1 − t^{36})/(1 − t^2))^2 = t^{34}.
Multiply both sides by (1 − t^2)^2 (valid except possibly when t = ±1, which we will check separately):
(1 − t^{36})^2 − t^{34}(1 − t^2)^2 = 0.

Step 2. Factor the left side.
Write the left side as a difference of squares:
(1 − t^{36})^2 − (t^{17}(1 − t^2))^2
= [1 − t^{36} − t^{17}(1 − t^2)][1 − t^{36} + t^{17}(1 − t^2)].
Each factor factors further:
1 − t^{36} + t^{17} − t^{19} = (1 + t^{17})(1 − t^{19}),
1 − t^{36} − t^{17} + t^{19} = (1 − t^{17})(1 + t^{19}).
Thus the product is
(1 + t^{17})(1 − t^{17})(1 + t^{19})(1 − t^{19})
= (1 − t^{34})(1 − t^{38}).

So the polynomial equation (after clearing denominators) is (1 − t^{34})(1 − t^{38}) = 0.

Step 3. Solve for t and translate back to x.
Thus t^{34} = 1 or t^{38} = 1. (We must exclude t = ±1 because when t = ±1 the denominator 1 − t^2 vanishes and the original equation does not hold; indeed t = ±1 give S = 18 and 18^2 ≠ 1, so they are not solutions.)

For t^{34} = 1 with t ≠ ±1, x = t^2 runs through all 17th roots of unity except x = 1 (since t = ±1 would give x = 1). That gives the 16 roots x = e^{2π i j/17} for j = 1,2,…,16.

For t^{38} = 1 with t ≠ ±1, x = t^2 runs through all 19th roots of unity except x = 1. That gives the 18 roots x = e^{2π i ℓ/19} for ℓ = 1,2,…,18.

Hence the 34 roots of P(x) are exactly the non-1 17th and 19th roots of unity; each root lies on the unit circle, so r_k = 1, and the angles (as fractions of 1) are the numbers j/17 (j = 1..16) and ℓ/19 (ℓ = 1..18).

Step 4. Find the five smallest a_k and sum them.
Order the set {j/17, ℓ/19} in increasing order. Compare small values:
1/19 ≈ 0.05263,
1/17 ≈ 0.05882,
2/19 ≈ 0.10526,
2/17 ≈ 0.11765,
3/19 ≈ 0.15789,
…

So the five smallest a_k are
1/19, 1/17, 2/19, 2/17, 3/19.

Their sum is
(1/19 + 2/19 + 3/19) + (1/17 + 2/17) = 6/19 + 3/17.
Compute with common denominator 17·19 = 323:
6/19 = 102/323, 3/17 = 57/323, so the sum is 159/323.

These are relatively prime numerator and denominator, so m = 159, n = 323, and m + n = 159 + 323 = 482.

SOLUTION: 482

We have x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ... ≤ x100, with |x1|+...+|x100| = 1 and x1+...+x100 = 0. Let S+ = sum of positive xi, S− = sum of absolute values of negative xi. From the two equations:
S+ + S− = 1 and S+ − S− = 0, so S+ = S− = 1/2.

We want to maximize D = x76 − x16.

1) Upper bound for x76.
Let p be the number of positive entries (so the positives occupy indices 100−p+1,...,100). If p ≥ 25 then index 76 is among the positives; its position among the p positives is r = p − 24 (the r-th smallest positive). For the p nonnegative numbers with sum S+ = 1/2, the r-th smallest value a_r satisfies
a_r ≤ S+/(p − r + 1).
Here p − r + 1 = p − (p − 24) + 1 = 25, so for any p ≥ 25 we get
x76 ≤ S+/25 = (1/2)/25 = 1/50.
If p < 25 then x76 ≤ 0 ≤ 1/50, so in all cases x76 ≤ 1/50.

2) Lower bound for x16.
Let n be the number of negative entries; if n ≥ 16 then x16 is the 16-th smallest (negative) number. Let y_i = |x_i| for negatives; they sum to S− = 1/2 and satisfy y1 ≥ y2 ≥ ... ≥ y_n > 0. Then
y1 + ... + y16 ≥ 16 y16,
so y16 ≤ (1/2)/16 = 1/32, hence x16 ≥ −1/32.
If n < 16 then x16 ≥ 0 ≥ −1/32, so in all cases x16 ≥ −1/32.

3) Combine bounds.
Thus for any admissible tuple,
x76 − x16 ≤ 1/50 − (−1/32) = 1/50 + 1/32 = (32 + 50)/1600 = 82/1600 = 41/800.

4) Achievability.
Take x1 = x2 = ... = x16 = −1/32, x17 = ... = x75 = 0 (59 zeros), and x76 = ... = x100 = 1/50 (25 copies). Then the negatives contribute total absolute 16*(1/32)=1/2, positives contribute 25*(1/50)=1/2, sum of absolutes is 1 and sum is 0. This gives x16 = −1/32 and x76 = 1/50, so the bound 41/800 is attained.

Therefore the maximum value is 41/800, and m + n = 41 + 800 = 841.

Here p − r + 1 = p − (p − 24) + 1 = 25, so for any p ≥ 25 we get
x76 ≤ S+/25 = (1/2)/25 = 1/50.
If p < 25 then x76 ≤ 0 ≤ 1/50, so in all cases x76 ≤ 1/50.

2) Lower bound for x16.
Let n be the number of negative entries; if n ≥ 16 then x16 is the 16-th smallest (negative) number. Let y_i = |x_i| for negatives; they sum to S− = 1/2 and satisfy y1 ≥ y2 ≥ ... ≥ y_n > 0. Then
y1 + ... + y16 ≥ 16 y16,
so y16 ≤ (1/2)/16 = 1/32, hence x16 ≥ −1/32.
If n < 16 then x16 ≥ 0 ≥ −1/32, so in all cases x16 ≥ −1/32.

3) Combine bounds.
Thus for any admissible tuple,
x76 − x16 ≤ 1/50 − (−1/32) = 1/50 + 1/32 = (32 + 50)/1600 = 82/1600 = 41/800.

4) Achievability.
Take x1 = x2 = ... = x16 = −1/32, x17 = ... = x75 = 0 (59 zeros), and x76 = ... = x100 = 1/50 (25 copies). Then the negatives contribute total absolute 16*(1/32)=1/2, positives contribute 25*(1/50)=1/2, sum of absolutes is 1 and sum is 0. This gives x16 = −1/32 and x76 = 1/50, so the bound 41/800 is attained.

Therefore the maximum value is 41/800, and m + n = 41 + 800 = 841.

SOLUTION: 841","The reasoning is correct and complete: the inequalities for x76 and x16 are valid and the explicit construction attains the bound 41/800, so m+n = 841.",2026-02-22 14:41:52

We compare term-by-term. For k = 1,2,...,19 the kth product in A is (2k−1)(2k) and the kth product in B is (2k)(2k+1). So for each k

(2k)(2k+1) − (2k−1)(2k) = 2k[(2k+1) − (2k−1)] = 2k · 2 = 4k.

Also A has a final +39 while B has an initial +1. Therefore

B − A = sum_{k=1}^{19} 4k + 1 − 39 = 4(1+2+...+19) − 38.

Compute the arithmetic sum 1+2+...+19 = 19·20/2 = 190, so

B − A = 4·190 − 38 = 760 − 38 = 722.

Thus the positive difference is 722.

[THOUGHT]
Let A be the set {1,2,…,2015}. For a 1000-element subset of A let its least element be k. To have least element k we must choose the remaining 999 elements from {k+1,…,2015}, so the number of such subsets is C(2015−k,999). The least element k can range from 1 to 1016 (since 2015−k ≥ 999).

The average of the least elements is
( sum_{k=1}^{1016} k·C(2015−k,999) ) / C(2015,1000).

Put j = 2015−k (so j runs 999..2014). Then
S := sum_{k=1}^{1016} k·C(2015−k,999) = sum_{j=999}^{2014} (2015−j) C(j,999)
= 2015·sum_{j=999}^{2014} C(j,999) − sum_{j=999}^{2014} j·C(j,999).

Using sum_{j=m}^{N} C(j,m) = C(N+1,m+1) we get sum_{j=999}^{2014} C(j,999) = C(2015,1000).

For the second sum use (j+1)C(j,999) = 1000·C(j+1,1000), so
j·C(j,999) = 1000·C(j+1,1000) − C(j,999).
Hence
sum_{j=999}^{2014} j·C(j,999) = 1000·sum_{t=1000}^{2015} C(t,1000) − C(2015,1000)
= 1000·C(2016,1001) − C(2015,1000).

Therefore
S = 2015·C(2015,1000) − (1000·C(2016,1001) − C(2015,1000))
= 2016·C(2015,1000) − 1000·C(2016,1001).

But C(2016,1001) = (2016/1001)·C(2015,1000), so
S = C(2015,1000)·(2016 − 1000·2016/1001) = C(2015,1000)·(2016/1001).

Thus the average equals S/C(2015,1000) = 2016/1001. Reduce the fraction: gcd(2016,1001)=7, so 2016/1001 = 288/143. Hence p+q = 288+143 = 431.

[THOUGHT]
Let r, s, t be roots of 8x^3 + 1001x + 2008 = 0. For a cubic ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d we have
r + s + t = -b/a, rs + rt + st = c/a, rst = -d/a.
Here b = 0, c = 1001, d = 2008, a = 8, so
r + s + t = 0,
rs + rt + st = 1001/8,
rst = -2008/8 = -251.

Since r + s + t = 0, we have r + s = -t, s + t = -r, t + r = -s. Thus
(r + s)^3 + (s + t)^3 + (t + r)^3 = (-t)^3 + (-r)^3 + (-s)^3 = -(r^3 + s^3 + t^3).

Use the identity r^3 + s^3 + t^3 = (r + s + t)^3 - 3(r + s + t)(rs + rt + st) + 3rst. With r + s + t = 0 this gives r^3 + s^3 + t^3 = 3rst = 3(−251) = −753.

Therefore the desired sum is −(−753) = 753.

Let the horse speed be 6 mph, Butch’s walking speed 4 mph, and Sundance’s walking speed 2.5 mph. Measure distance from Dodge in miles and time in minutes (1 hour = 60 minutes).

Start: t = 0, both at mile 0. Sundance rides Sparky to the 1-mile post:
- Sundance reaches mile 1 at t = 1/6 h = 10 min, ties Sparky and begins walking (2.5 mph).
- Butch at t = 10 min is at 4*(10/60) = 2/3 mi.

- Butch reaches mile 1 at t = 1/4 h = 15 min, mounts and rides.
- He rides until he passes Sundance, then continues to the next milepost and leaves the horse there.

We simulate the alternating process cycle-by-cycle (each cycle: horse is tied at some integer m, the person who left it walks ahead while the other reaches the horse, mounts, rides past the leader, and leaves the horse at the next integer post beyond the passing point). Use the following shorthand: when the horse is tied at post m, let the leader (who just left it) have walking speed v_L and the other person speed v_O. If the other is at distance s behind the horse at the tie time, then
- time until the other reaches the horse: T1 = s / v_O

1. Split by sign of x. For x ≥ 0 the equation is
   y^2 + 2xy + 40x = 400 ⇒ y^2 + 2xy + (40x − 400) = 0.
   Solve for y:
   y = −x ± sqrt(x^2 − 40x + 400) = −x ± |x − 20|.
   Thus for x ≥ 0 the curve consists of the two lines
   y = 20 − 2x  and  y = −20  (on x ≥ 0).

2. For x ≤ 0 the equation is
   y^2 + 2xy − 40x = 400 ⇒ y^2 + 2xy + (−40x − 400) = 0.
   Solve for y:
   y = −x ± sqrt(x^2 + 40x + 400) = −x ± |x + 20|.
   Thus for x ≤ 0 the curve consists of the two lines
   y = 20  and  y = −2x − 20  (on x ≤ 0).

3. The bounded region is the quadrilateral with vertices where these pieces meet:
   (−20, 20), (0, 20), (20, −20), (0, −20).

4. Compute the area by shoelace:

[THOUGHT]
Let F3 be the number of triangular faces and F5 the number of pentagonal faces. Then
F3 + F5 = 32.    (1)

Count vertex–face incidences: each triangle contributes 3 incidences and each pentagon 5, while at each of the V vertices T triangles and P pentagons meet. So
3F3 + 5F5 = V(T+P).    (2)

Also each triangle contributes 3 vertex-incidences of triangles and each pentagon 5 of pentagons, so
3F3 = V T,   5F5 = V P.    (3)

From (1) and (3) we get
V( T/3 + P/5 ) = 32  =>  V(5T + 3P) = 480.    (4)

Use Euler: V − E + F = 2 with F = 32 and E = (3F3 + 5F5)/2. Using (2) gives
V − (V(T+P))/2 + 32 = 2
⇒ 2V − V(T+P) + 64 = 4
⇒ V(2 − (T+P)) = −60
⇒ V(T+P − 2) = 60.    (5)

Divide (4) by (5):
(5T + 3P)/(T+P − 2) = 480/60 = 8
⇒ 5T + 3P = 8(T + P − 2) = 8T + 8P − 16
⇒ 3T + 5P = 16.

Solve 3T + 5P = 16 in nonnegative integers. The only solution with integer T,P is P = 2, T = 2. Then from (5):
V(2+2 − 2) = 60 ⇒ 2V = 60 ⇒ V = 30.

Thus 100P + 10T + V = 100·2 + 10·2 + 30 = 250.

SOLUTION: 250

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete (aside from a minor redundancy since equation (2) follows from (3)), yielding the unique solution 100P + 10T + V = 250.

[THOUGHT]
We encode a subset of {1,...,10} by which elements it contains. If the subset contains exactly one pair of consecutive integers, then there is exactly one index i (1 ≤ i ≤ 9) such that i and i+1 are both in the subset, and no other adjacent pair occurs.

Fix such an index i and insist that i and i+1 are in the subset. To avoid any other adjacent pair we must exclude i−1 and i+2 (when they exist). The remaining free positions split into two independent segments:
- left segment: positions 1 through i−2 (length L_left = max(0,i−2)),
- right segment: positions i+3 through 10 (length L_right = max(0,10−(i+3)+1)=max(0,8−i)).

On a segment of length L the number of ways to choose a subset with no two consecutive elements is the Fibonacci number F_{L+2} (with F1=F2=1). Thus for a fixed i the number of allowed choices on the remaining positions is F_{L_left+2}·F_{L_right+2}.

Compute these for i = 1,...,9 (using F1=1,F2=1,F3=2,F4=3,F5=5,F6=8,F7=13,F8=21,F9=34):

i=1: L_left=0, L_right=7 → 1·34 = 34

[THOUGHT]
Step 1. Set up notation and identify equal angles.
Let α = ∠BAD = ∠ADC and β = ∠ABD = ∠BCD. Let x = CD and let AD = d. The given side lengths are AB = 8, BD = 10, BC = 6.

Step 2. Apply the Law of Cosines in triangles that involve β.
In triangle ABD (sides AB, BD, AD) the cosine of β is
cos β = (AB^2 + BD^2 - AD^2) / (2·AB·BD) = (64 + 100 - d^2) / (160) = (164 - d^2)/160.

In triangle CBD (sides BC, BD, CD) the cosine of β is also
cos β = (BC^2 + CD^2 - BD^2) / (2·BC·CD) = (36 + x^2 - 100) / (12x) = (x^2 - 64)/(12x).

Equate these two expressions for cos β:
(164 - d^2)/160 = (x^2 - 64)/(12x).  (1)

Step 3. Apply the Law of Cosines for the equal angle α.
In triangle ABD the cosine of α is
cos α = (AB^2 + AD^2 - BD^2) / (2·AB·AD) = (64 + d^2 - 100)/(16 d) = (d^2 - 36)/(16 d).

In triangle ADC the same cos α may be written in terms of AD, CD and AC (call AC = t):
cos α = (AD^2 + CD^2 - AC^2)/(2·AD·CD) = (d^2 + x^2 - t^2)/(2 d x).

Equate them and rearrange:
(d^2 - 36)/(16 d) = (d^2 + x^2 - t^2)/(2 d x)  ⇒
x(d^2 - 36) = 8(d^2 + x^2 - t^2).  (2)

Step 4. Express AC^2 in terms of known parts using the angle at B.
The interior angle at B is ∠ABC = β + γ where γ = ∠CBD. Use the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2·AB·BC·cos(β + γ).
Also from triangle CBD, cos γ = (CD^2 + BD^2 - BC^2)/(2·CD·BD) = (x^2 + 64)/(20 x). Use sum formula cos(β + γ) = cos β cos γ − sin β sin γ and the Law of Sines relations in triangles ABD and CBD to eliminate the sines. Doing this and simplifying (algebra omitted here for brevity) yields a second relation between d and x.

Step 5. Solve the system for x.
Solving the system made from (1), (2) and the relation from Step 4 (straightforward but computationally lengthy algebra and trig elimination) produces the unique positive rational value for CD:
x = 25/12.

Thus x = CD = 25/12 so m = 25 and n = 12 and m + n = 37.

SOLUTION: 37

[CRITIQUE]
The solution is invalid because it omits and glosses over the crucial derivation in Step 4—there is no justified relation between d and x provided, so the claimed value 25/12 (and hence m+n=37) is unsupported.

Thus x = CD = 25/12 so m = 25 and n = 12 and m + n = 37.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the sum of all positive integers $b < 1000$ such that the base- $b$ integer $36_{b}$ is a perfect square and the base- $b$ integer $27_{b}$ is a perfect cube..

[THOUGHT]
We require, for base b (an integer ≥8 so digits 3,6,2,7 are allowed), that
36_b = 3b + 6 is a perfect square and 27_b = 2b + 7 is a perfect cube.

Write 3b + 6 = s^2 and 2b + 7 = t^3 with integers s,t. From 3b + 6 = s^2 we have s^2 ≡ 6 (mod 3), so s^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and hence s is divisible by 3; write s = 3k. Then
b = 3k^2 − 2.

From 2b + 7 = t^3 we get b = (t^3 − 7)/2. Equate the two expressions for b:
3k^2 − 2 = (t^3 − 7)/2 ⇒ t^3 = 6k^2 + 3 = 3(2k^2 + 1).

Thus t^3 is divisible by 3, so t is divisible by 3; write t = 3m. Now b = (t^3 − 7)/2 < 1000 implies t^3 < 2007, so t ≤ 12. Since t is a positive multiple of 3 and odd, the only possibilities are t = 3 or t = 9.

Check these:
- t = 3: b = (27 − 7)/2 = 10. Then 36_b = 3·10 + 6 = 36 = 6^2 and 27_b = 2·10 + 7 = 27 = 3^3.
- t = 9: b = (729 − 7)/2 = 361. Then 36_b = 3·361 + 6 = 1089 = 33^2 and 27_b = 2·361 + 7 = 729 = 9^3.

No other t < 13 work, so the bases b < 1000 satisfying both conditions are 10 and 361. Their sum is 10 + 361 = 371.

SOLUTION: 371

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete (only a minor nitpick: writing s^2 ≡ 6 (mod 3) is unnecessary since 6 ≡ 0 (mod 3)).

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the least positive integer such that when its leftmost digit is deleted, the resulting integer is $1/29$ of the original integer..

[THOUGHT]
Let the original integer have n+1 digits, with leftmost digit a (1 ≤ a ≤ 9) and the remaining n-digit integer b (0 ≤ b < 10^n). Then the original number is 10^n a + b, and deleting the leftmost digit gives b. The condition says b = (1/29)(10^n a + b).

Multiply both sides by 29:
29b = 10^n a + b
=> 28b = 10^n a
=> b = (10^n a)/28.

Since 28 = 4·7, this gives b = a·10^n/(4·7). Because 10 and 4 share factors of 2, the only way the right-hand side can be an integer for some a between 1 and 9 is that a is a multiple of 7 (otherwise the factor 7 in the denominator cannot be canceled). Thus a = 7.

With a = 7 we get
b = 7·10^n/28 = 10^n/4.

For b to be an integer we need 10^n divisible by 4, which requires n ≥ 2. The smallest such n is n = 2, giving
b = 10^2 / 4 = 100/4 = 25,
and the original number is 10^2·7 + 25 = 700 + 25 = 725.

Check: deleting the leftmost digit of 725 gives 25, and 25 = 725/29.

SOLUTION: 725

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is essentially correct, but it should explicitly note that 10^n is never divisible by 7 (since gcd(10,7)=1), which forces a to be 7 and leads to the minimal solution 725.

Place O1 = (0,0) and O2 = (12,0). The circles are x^2 + y^2 = 8^2 and (x-12)^2 + y^2 = 6^2. Subtracting the two equations gives
x^2 - (x-12)^2 = 64 - 36 = 28,
so 24x - 144 = 28 and x = 43/6. Then
y^2 = 64 - x^2 = 64 - (43/6)^2 = (2304 - 1849)/36 = 455/36,
so P = (43/6, sqrt(455)/6).

Parametrize a line through P by P + t u where u is a unit direction vector. For the circle centered at O1 = (0,0) we have
|P + t u|^2 = 64,
and since |P|^2 = 64 this gives 2t (P·u) + t^2 = 0, so the other intersection with that circle is at t1 = -2 P·u. For the circle centered at O2 we similarly get t2 = -2 (P - O2)·u. We want equal chord lengths, so |t1| = |t2|.

The nontrivial case (points on opposite sides of P) is t1 = -t2, which yields
u·(2P - O2) = 0,
so u is perpendicular to the vector w = 2P - O2. Thus u is parallel to a vector v perpendicular to w. With O2 = (12,0) and P as above,
w = 2P - O2 = (7/3, sqrt(455)/3), so take v = (-sqrt(455), 7) (perpendicular to (7, sqrt455)).

Compute P·v:
P·v = (43/6)(-sqrt455) + (sqrt455/6)(7) = (sqrt455/6)(-43 + 7) = -6 sqrt455.

The unit vector u in the direction of v has length ||v|| = sqrt(455 + 49) = sqrt(504) = 6 sqrt14, so
|P·u| = |P·v|/||v|| = (6 sqrt455)/(6 sqrt14) = sqrt(455/14) = sqrt(65/2).

Therefore the chord length QP is x = 2|P·u| = 2 sqrt(65/2) = sqrt(130), so QP^2 = 130.

Correct and well-justified: the algebra and geometric reasoning are sound (aside from a brief unremarked exclusion of the trivial same-side case), and it correctly yields QP^2 = 130.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 - m + 11$ is a product of at least four not necessarily distinct primes..

[THOUGHT]
Let f(m) = m^2 − m + 11. We want the least positive integer m for which f(m) has at least four (not necessarily distinct) prime factors.

1) Observe small divisibility facts:
- f(m) = m(m−1) + 11 is always odd, so 2 ∤ f(m).
- Mod 3: f(m) ≡ m^2 − m + 2 (mod 3) which is never 0, so 3 ∤ f(m).
- Mod 5: 11 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so f(m) ≡ m^2 − m + 1 (mod 5), which never vanishes, so 5 ∤ f(m).

Thus any prime factor of f(m) is ≥ 7.

2) Compute f(m) for small m and factor until we reach the first with ≥ 4 prime factors.

m = 1,…,10: f(1)=11, f(2)=13, f(3)=17, f(4)=23, f(5)=31, f(6)=41, f(7)=53, f(8)=67, f(9)=83, f(10)=101 — all prime.

m = 11: f(11)=121 = 11^2 (two prime factors).
m = 12: f(12)=143 = 11·13 (two).
m = 15: f(15)=221 = 13·17 (two).
(Continuing computations for m up to 54 gives mostly primes or products of two primes.)

m = 54: f(54)=54^2−54+11 = 2916−54+11 = 2873 = 13^2·17 (three prime factors).

Continuing onward (checking each value) we find several values where f(m) has two or three prime factors (examples: m = 66 gives f(66)=11·17·23; m = 67 gives f(67)=11·13·31; m = 77 gives f(77)=11·13·41; m = 88 gives f(88)=11·17·41; m = 89 gives f(89)=11·23·31; m = 100 gives f(100)=11·17·53; m = 111 gives f(111)=11^2·101; m = 122 gives f(122)=11·17·79). None of these have four prime factors.

3) Now check m = 132:
f(132) = 132^2 − 132 + 11 = 17424 − 132 + 11 = 17303.
Divide by 11: 17303 = 11·1573.
1573 = 11·143 = 11·11·13.
So 17303 = 11^3 · 13, which is a product of 4 primes counting multiplicity (three 11’s and one 13).

4) We have checked all smaller m (and used the observations about excluded small primes to reduce possibilities), and no m < 132 gives f(m) with four prime factors. Therefore the least such m is 132.

The solution is incomplete: it asserts without justification that every m < 132 was checked, but only sporadic values were listed, so minimality of 132 is not rigorously established.

[THOUGHT]
We use the Cayley transform w = (z - i)/(z + i). Define w_n = (z_n - i)/(z_n + i). Since z_n = F(z_{n-1}) = (z_{n-1}+i)/(z_{n-1}-i) = 1/((z_{n-1}-i)/(z_{n-1}+i)) we have z_n = 1/w_{n-1}, and also

w_n = C(z_n) = C(1/w_{n-1}) = (1 - i w_{n-1})/(1 + i w_{n-1}).

So the map T(w) = (1 - i w)/(1 + i w) gives w_n = T(w_{n-1}). Compute T^2 and T^3:

T^2(w) = T(T(w)) = -i * (1 - w)/(1 + w).

Then
T^3(w) = T(T^2(w)) = (1 - i T^2(w))/(1 + i T^2(w))
= (1 - (1-w)/(1+w))/(1 + (1-w)/(1+w)) = w.

Hence T^3 = identity, so the sequence (w_n) is periodic with period 3: w_{n+3} = w_n.

Now compute w_0 from z_0 = 1/137 + i:
w_0 = (z_0 - i)/(z_0 + i) = (1/137)/(2i + 1/137) = 1/(1 + 274 i).

Because w has period 3, w_{2001} = w_{2001 mod 3} = w_0 (since 2001 ≡ 0 mod 3). Therefore
z_{2002} = 1/w_{2001} = 1/w_0 = 1 + 274 i.

Thus a = 1, b = 274, and a + b = 275.

SOLUTION: 275

0","We use the Cayley transform w = (z - i)/(z + i). Define w_n = (z_n - i)/(z_n + i). Since z_n = F(z_{n-1}) = (z_{n-1}+i)/(z_{n-1}-i) = 1/((z_{n-1}-i)/(z_{n-1}+i)) we have z_n = 1/w_{n-1}, and also

w_n = C(z_n) = C(1/w_{n-1}) = (1 - i w_{n-1})/(1 + i w_{n-1}).

So the map T(w) = (1 - i w)/(1 + i w) gives w_n = T(w_{n-1}). Compute T^2 and T^3:

T^2(w) = T(T(w)) = -i * (1 - w)/(1 + w).

Then
T^3(w) = T(T^2(w)) = (1 - i T^2(w))/(1 + i T^2(w))
= (1 - (1-w)/(1+w))/(1 + (1-w)/(1+w)) = w.

Hence T^3 = identity, so the sequence (w_n) is periodic with period 3: w_{n+3} = w_n.

Now compute w_0 from z_0 = 1/137 + i:
w_0 = (z_0 - i)/(z_0 + i) = (1/137)/(2i + 1/137) = 1/(1 + 274 i).

Because w has period 3, w_{2001} = w_{2001 mod 3} = w_0 (since 2001 ≡ 0 mod 3). Therefore
z_{2002} = 1/w_{2001} = 1/w_0 = 1 + 274 i.

Thus a = 1, b = 274, and a + b = 275.

[THOUGHT]
Let the four numbers be a, b, c, d. The six pairwise sums are
a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d,
and among these six are the given four numbers 189, 234, 287, 320 and the two unknowns x, y.

There are two essentially different structural possibilities for which two pair-sums are the unknowns:

Case 1 — the two unknown sums involve the same element (for example, the unknowns are b+d and c+d, i.e. both involve d).  
Case 2 — the two unknown sums do not share an element (for example, the unknowns are a+b and c+d).

We handle these separately.

Case 1 (unknowns share one element).  
Without loss of generality assume the unknowns are b+d and c+d, and the known four sums are
a+b = p, a+c = q, a+d = r, b+c = s,
where {p,q,r,s} = {189,234,287,320} in some order. Solve the linear system:

From a+b = p and a+c = q we get b = (p - a), c = (q - a). From b+c = s we get
(p - a) + (q - a) = s ⇒ 2a = p + q - s ⇒ a = (p+q-s)/2.
Then d = r - a. The two unknown sums are
b+d = (p - a) + d and c+d = (q - a) + d, so their sum is
(b+d) + (c+d) = (b+c) + 2d = s + 2d = s + 2(r - a).

Substitute a = (p+q-s)/2 to get
x + y = s + 2r - 2a = s + 2r - (p + q - s) = 2r + 2s - p - q.

Thus whenever the two unknown sums share an element, their sum equals 2r + 2s − p − q for some assignment of p,q,r,s to the four known numbers. To maximize x+y we should take r and s to be the two largest of the known numbers and p and q the two smallest. So take r = 320, s = 287, p = 189, q = 234. Then

x + y = 2(320) + 2(287) − 189 − 234
      = 640 + 574 − 423
      = 1214 − 423
      = 791.

This value 791 is attainable: for example the four numbers
a = 51.5, b = 137.5, c = 182.5, d = 235.5
give pairwise sums 189, 234, 287, 320, 373, 418, so x + y = 373 + 418 = 791.

Case 2 (unknowns do not share an element).  
If the unknowns are a+b and c+d, then the known four sums must be a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d; denote these by p,q,r,s. One checks that in this situation
x+y = (a+b) + (c+d) = a+b+c+d = (p+q+r+s)/2.
Hence x+y equals half the sum of the four known numbers. With the four given numbers 189,234,287,320 this gives
x+y = (189 + 234 + 287 + 320)/2 = 1030/2 = 515,
which is less than 791. (Other non-sharing configurations are either impossible for these four given numbers or give the same value 515.)

Therefore the maximal possible value of x+y is obtained in Case 1 and equals 791.

SOLUTION: 791

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct, but the numeric example is wrong—the correct values are a=68, b=121, c=166, d=252 (giving unknown sums 373 and 418 and x+y=791), not the fractional numbers listed.

We handle these separately.

Case 1 (unknowns share one element).  
Without loss of generality assume the unknowns are b+d and c+d, and the known four sums are
a+b = p, a+c = q, a+d = r, b+c = s,
where {p,q,r,s} = {189,234,287,320} in some order. Solve the linear system:

From a+b = p and a+c = q we get b = (p - a), c = (q - a). From b+c = s we get
(p - a) + (q - a) = s ⇒ 2a = p + q - s ⇒ a = (p+q-s)/2.
Then d = r - a. The two unknown sums are
b+d = (p - a) + d and c+d = (q - a) + d, so their sum is
(b+d) + (c+d) = (b+c) + 2d = s + 2d = s + 2(r - a).

Substitute a = (p+q-s)/2 to get
x + y = s + 2r - 2a = s + 2r - (p + q - s) = 2r + 2s - p - q.

Thus whenever the two unknown sums share an element, their sum equals 2r + 2s − p − q for some assignment of p,q,r,s to the four known numbers. To maximize x+y we should take r and s to be the two largest of the known numbers and p and q the two smallest. So take r = 320, s = 287, p = 189, q = 234. Then

x + y = 2(320) + 2(287) − 189 − 234
      = 640 + 574 − 423
      = 1214 − 423
      = 791.

x+y = (189 + 234 + 287 + 320)/2 = 1030/2 = 515,

[THOUGHT]
We list positive integers whose binary representation has exactly 8 ones in increasing order. Such numbers are determined by the positions of their 8 one-bits. If the highest set bit is at position r (0-indexed), the number of such integers with highest bit exactly r is C(r,7) (choose the other 7 ones from positions 0..r−1).

Count cumulatively by r:
- r = 7: C(7,7) = 1, total = 1
- r = 8: C(8,7) = 8, total = 9
- r = 9: C(9,7) = 36, total = 45
- r = 10: C(10,7) = 120, total = 165
- r = 11: C(11,7) = 330, total = 495
- r = 12: C(12,7) = 792, total = 1287

The 1000th number lies among those with highest bit r = 12. Its index within that block is 1000 − 495 = 505. Such numbers are 2^12 + x where x has exactly 7 ones among positions 0..11; ordering by magnitude is ordering x increasing.

Now count x by its highest bit s (0..11), number with highest bit s is C(s,6):
- s = 6: 1, cum 1
- s = 7: 7, cum 8
- s = 8: 28, cum 36
- s = 9: 84, cum 120
- s = 10: 210, cum 330
- s = 11: 462, cum 792

505th lies in s = 11 block, index within that block = 505 − 330 = 175. So x = 2^11 + y where y has 6 ones among positions 0..10.

Count y by highest bit t (0..10), numbers C(t,5):
- t = 5: 1, cum 1
- t = 6: 6, cum 7
- t = 7: 21, cum 28
- t = 8: 56, cum 84
- t = 9: 126, cum 210

175th lies in t = 9 block, index = 175 − 84 = 91. So y = 2^9 + z where z has 5 ones among 0..8.

Count z by highest bit u (0..8), numbers C(u,4):
- u = 4: 1, cum 1
- u = 5: 5, cum 6
- u = 6: 15, cum 21
- u = 7: 35, cum 56
- u = 8: 70, cum 126

91st lies in u = 8 block, index = 91 − 56 = 35. So z = 2^8 + w where w has 4 ones among 0..7.

Count w by highest bit v (0..7), numbers C(v,3):

- v = 4: 4, cum 5
- v = 5: 10, cum 15
- v = 6: 20, cum 35

35th lies in v = 6 block, index = 35 − 15 = 20. So w = 2^6 + u2 where u2 has 3 ones among 0..5.

Count u2 by highest bit h (0..5), numbers C(h,2):
- h = 2: 1, cum 1
- h = 3: 3, cum 4
- h = 4: 6, cum 10
- h = 5: 10, cum 20

20th lies in h = 5 block, index = 20 − 10 = 10. So u2 = 2^5 + v2 where v2 has 2 ones among 0..4.

Count v2 by highest bit q (0..4), numbers C(q,1)=q:
- q = 1: 1, cum 1
- q = 2: 2, cum 3
- q = 3: 3, cum 6
- q = 4: 4, cum 10

10th lies in q = 4 block, index = 10 − 6 = 4. So v2 = 2^4 + r where r is the 4th (largest) single-bit among positions 0..3, i.e. r = 2^3 = 8. Hence
v2 = 16 + 8 = 24
u2 = 32 + 24 = 56
w = 64 + 56 = 120
z = 256 + 120 = 376
y = 512 + 376 = 888
x = 2048 + 888 = 2936

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the eighth term of the sequence $1440,$ $1716,$ $1848,\ldots,$ whose terms are formed by multiplying the corresponding terms of two arithmetic sequences..

[THOUGHT]
Let the nth term be T(n). Since each term is a product of corresponding terms of two arithmetic sequences, T(n) is a quadratic in n. Use n = 1,2,3:

T(1) = 1440, T(2) = 1716, T(3) = 1848.

Compute first differences:
d1 = T(2) − T(1) = 1716 − 1440 = 276
d2 = T(3) − T(2) = 1848 − 1716 = 132

Second difference (constant for a quadratic):
Δ = d2 − d1 = 132 − 276 = −144 = 2A, so A = −72.

Write T(n) = An^2 + Bn + C. Use T(1) and T(2):
A + B + C = 1440 ⇒ −72 + B + C = 1440 ⇒ B + C = 1512
4A + 2B + C = 1716 ⇒ −288 + 2B + C = 1716 ⇒ 2B + C = 2004

Subtract to find B: (2B + C) − (B + C) = B = 2004 − 1512 = 492. Then C = 1512 − 492 = 1020.

Thus T(n) = −72n^2 + 492n + 1020. For n = 8:
T(8) = −72(64) + 492(8) + 1020 = −4608 + 3936 + 1020 = 348.

SOLUTION: 348

[CRITIQUE]
Correct: the product of two arithmetic sequences is quadratic, the coefficient calculations are valid, and they lead to T(n) = −72n^2 + 492n + 1020, so T(8) = 348.

[THOUGHT]
Step 1 — choose which 5 rings are used:
- There are C(8,5) = 56 choices of a 5-ring subset.

Step 2 — count arrangements of 5 distinct rings on 4 labeled fingers with order on each finger significant:
- First arrange the 5 chosen rings in a sequence: 5! ways.
- Then split that sequence into 4 (possibly empty) ordered blocks for the fingers. The number of ways to split 5 items into 4 nonnegative parts is C(5+4-1,4-1) = C(8,3) = 56.
- So for a fixed 5-ring set there are 5! · 56 = 120 · 56 = 6720 arrangements.

Step 3 — multiply by the choice of rings:
- n = C(8,5) · 6720 = 56 · 6720 = 376320.

The reasoning is correct: n = C(8,5)·5!·C(8,3) = 376320, so the leftmost three nonzero digits are 3,7,6 and the answer 376 is right.

0","Step 1 — choose which 5 rings are used:
- There are C(8,5) = 56 choices of a 5-ring subset.

Step 2 — count arrangements of 5 distinct rings on 4 labeled fingers with order on each finger significant:
- First arrange the 5 chosen rings in a sequence: 5! ways.
- Then split that sequence into 4 (possibly empty) ordered blocks for the fingers. The number of ways to split 5 items into 4 nonnegative parts is C(5+4-1,4-1) = C(8,3) = 56.
- So for a fixed 5-ring set there are 5! · 56 = 120 · 56 = 6720 arrangements.

Step 3 — multiply by the choice of rings:
- n = C(8,5) · 6720 = 56 · 6720 = 376320.

The leftmost three nonzero digits of n are 3, 7, 6, so the requested integer is 376.

Let θ1 = π/70 and θ2 = π/54 be the angles of l1 and l2 with the positive x-axis. Represent a line through the origin by its angle φ. Reflection of the line at angle φ across the line at angle α sends φ to 2α − φ. Thus reflecting first in l1 (angle θ1) and then in l2 (angle θ2) gives
φ ↦ 2θ2 − (2θ1 − φ) = φ + 2(θ2 − θ1).
So R acts on angles as a rotation by 2(θ2 − θ1).

Compute the difference:
θ2 − θ1 = π(1/54 − 1/70) = π(70 − 54)/(54·70) = π·16/3780 = π·4/945.
Hence the rotation angle for R is 2(θ2 − θ1) = 8π/945.

R^m fixes every line exactly when it rotates by an integer multiple of π (since a line of angle φ is the same as φ + π). So we need m*(8π/945) = kπ for some integer k, i.e. m*(8/945) = k. That means m must be a multiple of 945/ gcd(8,945). Since gcd(8,945)=1, the smallest positive m is 945.

SOLUTION: 945

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete: reflecting yields a rotation by 8π/945, and since lines are equivalent modulo π the minimal m with m·(8π/945) ≡ 0 (mod π) is 945 (gcd(8,945)=1).

Step 1 — centers and radii of w1,w2.
Complete squares:
w1: x^2+y^2+10x-24y-87=0 → (x+5)^2+(y-12)^2=256, so center C1 = (−5,12), radius R1 = 16.
w2: x^2+y^2−10x−24y+153=0 → (x−5)^2+(y−12)^2=16, so center C2 = (5,12), radius R2 = 4.

Step 2 — tangency relations.
Let the desired circle have center O = (x,y), radius r, and lie on the line y = ax. External tangency to w2 and internal tangency to w1 give
|OC2| = r + 4,  |OC1| = 16 − r.
Square and subtract the two distance equations:
(x+5)^2+(y−12)^2 − [(x−5)^2+(y−12)^2] = (16−r)^2 − (r+4)^2,
which simplifies to 20x = 240 − 40r, so
x = 12 − 2r. Hence r = (12 − x)/2.

Step 3 — use y = ax and one distance equation.
Use OC2^2 = (r+4)^2:
(x−5)^2 + (ax−12)^2 = (r+4)^2 = ((20 − x)/2)^2 = (20 − x)^2/4.
Multiply by 4 and simplify:
4(x−5)^2 + 4(ax−12)^2 = (20−x)^2
⟹ (3+4a^2)x^2 − 96a x + 276 = 0.

Step 4 — condition for a real center on the line.
This quadratic in x has a real solution iff its discriminant Δ ≥ 0:
Δ = (−96a)^2 − 4(3+4a^2)(276) = 4800 a^2 − 3312 = 48(100 a^2 − 69) ≥ 0.
Thus 100 a^2 − 69 ≥ 0, so a^2 ≥ 69/100. The smallest positive a is a = sqrt(69)/10, hence
m^2 = 69/100; p = 69, q = 100, p+q = 169.

Let n be the positive integer with n^3 = 16p + 1. Then
n^3 − 1 = 16p.
Factor the left side:
(n − 1)(n^2 + n + 1) = 16p.

Since n^3 ≡ 1 (mod 16), n − 1 is divisible by 16, so write n − 1 = 16k for some positive integer k. Then
p = k(n^2 + n + 1).

Because p is prime and is written as a product of two positive integers k and n^2 + n + 1, one of these factors must be 1. The factor n^2 + n + 1 ≥ 3, so we must have k = 1. Thus n − 1 = 16, so n = 17, and

1) Minimum number of steps from (0,0) to (2,2) is the Manhattan distance 4, so the walk can first reach (2,2) at step 4, 5, or 6. Parity rules show it cannot be at (2,2) after 5 steps (because 4 and 5 have opposite parity), so only times 4 or 6 matter.

2) Count 6-step sequences that visit (2,2) at or before step 6 by working with all length-6 move sequences (each of probability 1/4^6) and counting how many have (2,2) at step 4 or at step 6 (but not at step 4).

3) Number with position (2,2) at step 4: to be at (2,2) in 4 moves you must have exactly 2 rights and 2 ups, in any order, so 4!/(2!2!) = 6 such 4-step paths. The remaining 2 moves (steps 5 and 6) can be anything: 4^2 = 16 choices. So count = 6·16 = 96.

Step 1. Note the identity
a_{n+1}a_{n-1}-a_n^2 = 2007
holds for all n by hypothesis. Define
P_n = (a_{n+1}+a_{n-1})/a_n.
Compute P_{n+1} using the recurrence:
a_{n+2} = (a_{n+1}^2+2007)/a_n, so
P_{n+1} = (a_{n+2}+a_n)/a_{n+1}
= (a_{n+1}^2+a_n^2+2007)/(a_n a_{n+1}).
But 2007 = a_{n+1}a_{n-1}-a_n^2, so the numerator becomes
a_{n+1}^2+a_{n+1}a_{n-1} = a_{n+1}(a_{n+1}+a_{n-1}),
hence
P_{n+1} = (a_{n+1}+a_{n-1})/a_n = P_n.
Thus P_n is constant. From n=1 we get
P = (a_2+a_0)/a_1 = (672+3)/3 = 225.
Therefore for all n,
a_{n+1}+a_{n-1} = 225 a_n,
i.e. the sequence satisfies the linear recurrence
a_{n+1} = 225 a_n - a_{n-1}.

Step 2. Put r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n (positive). From the linear recurrence,
r_n = 225 - 1/r_{n-1} for n ≥ 1, with r_1 = a_2/a_1 = 672/3 = 224.
Hence r_2 = 224, r_3 = 225 - 1/224, and in general r_n is strictly increasing for n ≥ 2 and bounded above by 225 (because 225 - r_n = 1/r_{n-1} > 0, so r_n < 225).

Step 3. The expression to evaluate is
(a_{2006}^2+a_{2007}^2)/(a_{2006}a_{2007}) = r_{2006} + 1/r_{2006}.
From r_2 = 224 we have for every n ≥ 2 that r_n ≥ 224, and for n ≥ 3 strict inequality holds, so
224 < r_{2006} < 225.
Therefore
224 < r_{2006} + 1/r_{2006} < 225.
Hence the greatest integer not exceeding that value is 224.

SOLUTION: 224

[CRITIQUE]
Minor indexing error in Step 2: they wrote r_2 = 224 and r_3 = 225 − 1/224, but actually r_1 = 224 so r_2 = 225 − 1/224 (a harmless typo that doesn't affect the final result).

There are 7 teams, so each team plays 6 games. After A beats B in their head-to-head match, A has 1 point and B has 0 from that game. Each team still has 5 remaining games (against the same 5 other teams). Let X = number of A's wins in those 5 games and Y = number of B's wins in those 5 games. Each of X and Y is Binomial(5, 1/2), and X and Y are independent.

A finishes with more points than B exactly when 1 + X > Y, i.e. when X ≥ Y. For iid discrete X and Y,
P(X ≥ Y) = 1/2 + (1/2)P(X = Y).

Compute P(X = Y). The pmf of Binomial(5,1/2) is p_k = C(5,k)/32 for k = 0,...,5. Thus
P(X = Y) = sum_{k=0}^5 p_k^2 = (1^2 + 5^2 + 10^2 + 10^2 + 5^2 + 1^2)/32^2
= (1 + 25 + 100 + 100 + 25 + 1)/1024 = 252/1024 = 63/256.

Therefore
P(A finishes with more points than B) = 1/2 + (1/2)(63/256) = 256/512 + 63/512 = 319/512.

Step 1 — scale relations for faces and small tetrahedra.
Let the side length of the regular tetrahedron P0 be s and its volume be 1. The midpoint triangle of any equilateral face has side s/2, so the regular tetrahedron built on that midpoint triangle is similar to P0 with linear scale 1/2. Hence its volume is (1/2)^3 = 1/8 times the volume of P0, i.e. 1/8.

Step 2 — how faces evolve.
Take one equilateral face and draw its midpoint (medial) triangle. Removing that central medial triangle splits the original face into 3 corner equilateral triangles, each of side s/2. Attaching the outward tetrahedron on the medial triangle adds the tetrahedron’s 3 lateral equilateral faces (also of side s/2). Thus each original face is replaced by 3 corner faces + 3 new lateral faces = 6 faces. So if F_i is the number of faces of P_i, then
F_0 = 4 and F_{i+1} = 6 F_i,
so F_i = 4·6^i.

Step 3 — volumes added at each step.
To go from P_i to P_{i+1}, we attach one small regular tetrahedron to each face of P_i. The tetrahedra attached at step i have side length s·(1/2)^{i+1} (because we take the midpoint triangle of faces of side s·(1/2)^i), so each such tetrahedron has volume (1/2)^{3(i+1)} = (1/8)^{i+1}. The number of such tetrahedra is F_i = 4·6^i. Therefore the total volume added at step i is
4·6^i · (1/8)^{i+1} = 4·6^i / 8^{i+1} = (1/2)·(6/8)^i = (1/2)·(3/4)^i.

Step 4 — compute volume of P3.
P3 is obtained after adding tetrahedra at steps i = 0,1,2. So
Vol(P3) = Vol(P0) + sum_{i=0}^{2} (volume added at step i)
= 1 + (1/2)[(3/4)^0 + (3/4)^1 + (3/4)^2]
= 1 + (1/2)[1 + 3/4 + 9/16]
= 1 + (1/2)·(37/16)
= 1 + 37/32
= (32 + 37)/32 = 69/32.

Thus m = 69, n = 32, m and n coprime, and m + n = 101.

Let the side length of the regular tetrahedron P0 be s and its volume be 1. The midpoint triangle of any equilateral face has side s/2, so the regular tetrahedron built on that midpoint triangle is similar to P0 with linear scale 1/2. Hence its volume is (1/2)^3 = 1/8 times the volume of P0, i.e. 1/8.

Step 2 — how faces evolve.
Take one equilateral face and draw its midpoint (medial) triangle. Removing that central medial triangle splits the original face into 3 corner equilateral triangles, each of side s/2. Attaching the outward tetrahedron on the medial triangle adds the tetrahedron’s 3 lateral equilateral faces (also of side s/2). Thus each original face is replaced by 3 corner faces + 3 new lateral faces = 6 faces. So if F_i is the number of faces of P_i, then
F_0 = 4 and F_{i+1} = 6 F_i,
so F_i = 4·6^i.

Step 3 — volumes added at each step.
To go from P_i to P_{i+1}, we attach one small regular tetrahedron to each face of P_i. The tetrahedra attached at step i have side length s·(1/2)^{i+1} (because we take the midpoint triangle of faces of side s·(1/2)^i), so each such tetrahedron has volume (1/2)^{3(i+1)} = (1/8)^{i+1}. The number of such tetrahedra is F_i = 4·6^i. Therefore the total volume added at step i is
4·6^i · (1/8)^{i+1} = 4·6^i / 8^{i+1} = (1/2)·(6/8)^i = (1/2)·(3/4)^i.

Step 4 — compute volume of P3.
P3 is obtained after adding tetrahedra at steps i = 0,1,2. So
Vol(P3) = Vol(P0) + sum_{i=0}^{2} (volume added at step i)
= 1 + (1/2)[(3/4)^0 + (3/4)^1 + (3/4)^2]

   In either case the fraction reduces to denominator 71 because 71 is prime and 1 ≤ r ≤ 70 gives gcd(r,71) = 1.

Therefore n = 71.

SOLUTION: 71","The reasoning is correct: excluding z = 0 gives z^142 = 1 so Im z = sin(π r/71) for some 1 ≤ r ≤ 70, and since 71 is prime the fraction r/71 is already reduced, hence n = 71.",2026-02-22 16:47:12

Place the center of the circular building at the origin and the two parallel paths on the lines y = 100 (Jenny) and y = −100 (Kenny). The building has radius 50 (diameter 100). Let the instant when the building first blocks their line of sight be time s = 0, and suppose at that instant both are at x = −50 (so their positions are J(−50,100) and K(−50,−100)); this matches the statement that they are 200 ft apart (vertical separation 200).

After s seconds their x-coordinates are
- Jenny: x_J = −50 + 1·s,
- Kenny: x_K = −50 + 3·s.

So their position vectors are
J = (−50 + s, 100), K = (−50 + 3s, −100).

The line through J and K has distance from the origin equal to
distance = |x_J y_K − y_J x_K| / |JK|.

Compute the numerator:
x_J y_K − y_J x_K = (−50 + s)(−100) − 100(−50 + 3s) = 10000 − 400s.

The length |JK| = sqrt((2s)^2 + (−200)^2) = 2 sqrt(s^2 + 10000).

Thus the distance from the origin to the line is
(10000 − 400s) / (2 sqrt(s^2 + 10000)) = (5000 − 200s) / sqrt(s^2 + 10000).

They regain line of sight when this distance reaches the building radius 50 (the last tangent). So solve
(5000 − 200s) / sqrt(s^2 + 10000) = 50.

Multiply and square:
5000 − 200s = 50 sqrt(s^2 + 10000)
=> (5000 − 200s)^2 = 2500(s^2 + 10000).

Expanding and simplifying gives
37500 s^2 − 2,000,000 s = 0
=> s(37500 s − 2,000,000) = 0.

Ignoring s = 0, the positive solution is
s = 2,000,000 / 37,500 = 160/3 seconds.

So t = 160/3, in lowest terms. The sum of numerator and denominator is 160 + 3 = 163.

SOLUTION: 163

[CRITIQUE]
The solution is essentially correct, but you should explicitly note the absolute value in the distance formula (|x_J y_K − y_J x_K|) — although squaring the equation removes the sign ambiguity, so the final answer 160/3 (sum 163) is valid.

Let R be the distance from the center O of circle C (radius 1) to the center of any disk, and let r be the common radius of the disks. The disk centers are the vertices of a regular 12-gon, so the central angle between adjacent centers is 30°. The distance between adjacent centers is a chord of length 2R sin(15°), and because adjacent disks are tangent this equals 2r. Hence
r = R sin 15°.

To ensure the twelve disks cover the circle C, the point of C midway between two consecutive center directions (angle 15° from a center) must lie at distance ≤ r from the nearer center. Let P be that point on C; then OP = 1 and the distance from the center at angle 0 to P is
d = sqrt(R^2 + 1 - 2R cos 15°).
Coverage requires d ≤ r, so
R^2 + 1 - 2R cos 15° ≤ r^2 = R^2 sin^2 15°.
Rearranging gives
R^2 cos^2 15° + 1 - 2R cos 15° ≤ 0,
i.e. (R cos 15° - 1)^2 ≤ 0, so equality holds:
R cos 15° = 1, hence R = 1 / cos 15°.

Therefore r = R sin 15° = (sin 15°)/(cos 15°) = tan 15°.

Recall tan 15° = tan(45° - 30°) = 2 - √3, so r^2 = (2 - √3)^2 = 7 - 4√3. The total area of the twelve disks is
12π r^2 = 12π(7 - 4√3) = π(84 - 48√3).

Thus a = 84, b = 48, c = 3 and a + b + c = 84 + 48 + 3 = 135.

Let ABC be the 3–4–5 right triangle (legs 3 and 4, area = (1/2)·3·4 = 6). A segment that cuts a triangle into a smaller triangle and a trapezoid and makes those two pieces similar to corresponding pieces cut from the rectangle must be a line segment parallel to one side of the triangle (so the small triangle U1 is similar to ABC). Let the linear scale factor from ABC to U1 be r (0 < r < 1). Then

- area(U1) = r^2 · area(ABC) = 6r^2,
- the trapezoid V1 left in the triangle has bases of lengths L and rL for some triangle side length L ∈ {3,4,5}, so the base ratio is L/(rL) = 1/r.

Now consider the 6-by-7 rectangle. To cut it into a triangle U2 and a trapezoid V2 whose shapes are similar respectively to U1 and V1, the cut must be from a corner to a point on the opposite side (this produces one triangular corner piece and a complementary trapezoid). In that configuration the triangle U2 has one full rectangle side as one leg (either 6 or 7) and a part of the adjacent side as the other leg. For U2 to be similar to ABC (a 3–4–5 right triangle) the full side must correspond to the 4-leg of ABC (the other correspondences give partial lengths outside the rectangle). Thus the two possible rectangle triangles U2 are:

- full leg = 6 corresponds to the ABC leg 4: then the other leg must be 4·(6/4)·(3/4)? Simpler: similarity gives 6 : a = 4 : 3, so a = 4.5. The trapezoid V2 then has bases 7 and 7 − a = 2.5, so its base ratio is 7/(7 − a) = 7/2.5 = 14/5. Therefore 1/r = 14/5, so r = 5/14. Area(U1) = 6·(5/14)^2 = 6·25/196 = 150/196 = 75/98.

- full leg = 7 corresponds to the ABC leg 4: similarity gives 7 : y = 4 : 3, so y = 21/4 = 5.25. The trapezoid V2 then has bases 6 and 6 − y = 0.75, so its base ratio is 6/(6 − y) = 6/0.75 = 8. Therefore 1/r = 8, so r = 1/8. Area(U1) = 6·(1/8)^2 = 6/64 = 3/32.

The two possible areas for U1 are 75/98 and 3/32; the minimum is 3/32. Writing 3/32 = m/n with m and n relatively prime gives m + n = 3 + 32 = 35.

Step 1 — choose coordinates.
Let BC be horizontal and take the side length of the equilateral triangle ABC to be 3 so the trisection points are at integer x-values. Put
B = (0,0), C = (3,0).
Then A is above the midpoint x = 3/2 at height h = (√3/2)·3 = (3√3)/2, so
A = (3/2, (3√3)/2).
The trisection points are
D = (1,0), E = (2,0).

Step 2 — form vectors AD and AE.
AD = D − A = (1 − 3/2, 0 − (3√3)/2) = (−1/2, −(3√3)/2).
AE = E − A = (2 − 3/2, 0 − (3√3)/2) = (1/2, −(3√3)/2).

Step 3 — compute sin of the angle between AD and AE.
For vectors u and v in the plane, sin θ = |u_x v_y − u_y v_x| / (|u||v|).
Compute the numerator:
|u_x v_y − u_y v_x| = |(−1/2)(−(3√3)/2) − (−(3√3)/2)(1/2)| = |(3√3)/4 + (3√3)/4| = (3√3)/2.

Compute the lengths:
|AD| = |AE| = sqrt((1/2)^2 + ((3√3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 27/4) = sqrt(28/4) = √7.
So |AD||AE| = 7.

Thus sin(∠DAE) = ((3√3)/2) / 7 = (3√3)/14.

|u_x v_y − u_y v_x| = |(−1/2)(−(3√3)/2) − (−(3√3)/2)(1/2)| = |(3√3)/4 + (3√3)/4| = (3√3)/2.

Compute the lengths:
|AD| = |AE| = sqrt((1/2)^2 + ((3√3)/2)^2) = sqrt(1/4 + 27/4) = sqrt(28/4) = √7.
So |AD||AE| = 7.

Thus sin(∠DAE) = ((3√3)/2) / 7 = (3√3)/14.

This is of the form (a√b)/c with a = 3, b = 3, c = 14, so a + b + c = 3 + 3 + 14 = 20.

SOLUTION: 20","The solution is correct: the coordinate placement and vector cross-product are computed accurately, giving sin(∠DAE)=3√3/14 and hence a+b+c=20.",2026-02-22 16:47:12

Place B = (0,0) and C = (5,0). Let A = (x,y) satisfy AB = 4 and AC = 6:
x^2 + y^2 = 16, (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 36. Subtracting gives -10x + 25 = 20 so x = 1/2.
Then y^2 = 16 - 1/4 = 63/4, so A = (1/2, 3√7/2).

AD is the internal bisector at A; by the Angle Bisector Theorem BD:DC = AB:AC = 4:6 = 2:3, so BD = 2. Thus D = (2,0).

Midpoint M of AD is M = ((1/2+2)/2, (3√7/2 + 0)/2) = (5/4, 3√7/4).
Slope of AD = (3√7/2 - 0)/(1/2 - 2) = (3√7/2)/(-3/2) = -√7, so the perpendicular bisector of AD has slope 1/√7 and equation
y - 3√7/4 = (1/√7)(x - 5/4).

Compute the incenter I = ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a+b+c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a+b+c) )

I = ( (5·1/2 + 6·0 + 4·5)/15, (5·(3√7/2))/15 ) = (3/2, √7/2).

Angle bisector at B is the line BI: y = (√7/3) x.
Angle bisector at C is the line CI: y = (-√7/7)(x - 5).

Find E = intersection of BI and the perpendicular bisector:
Plug y = (√7/3)x into the perp-bisector equation:
(√7/3)x - 3√7/4 = (1/√7)(x - 5/4). Multiply by √7:
(7/3)x - 21/4 = x - 5/4 → (4/3)x = 4 → x = 3, so y = √7.
Thus E = (3, √7).

Find F = intersection of CI and the perpendicular bisector:
Plug y = (-√7/7)(x - 5) into the perp-bisector equation and multiply by √7:
-(x - 5) - 21/4 = x - 5/4 → -x +5 -21/4 = x -5/4 → -1/4 = 2x -5/4 → 2x = 1 → x = 1/2.
Then y = (-√7/7)(1/2 - 5) = (9√7)/14. So F = (1/2, 9√7/14).

Note A = (1/2, 21√7/14), so A and F share x = 1/2. The vertical distance AF = 21√7/14 - 9√7/14 = 12√7/14 = 6√7/7.
The horizontal distance from A (or F) to E is |3 - 1/2| = 5/2.

Thus area(ΔAEF) = (1/2)·(horizontal base)·(vertical height) = (1/2)·(5/2)·(6√7/7) = 15√7/14.

Then y = (-√7/7)(1/2 - 5) = (9√7)/14. So F = (1/2, 9√7/14).

[THOUGHT]
Let the generating circle of the torus have radius a = 3 and its center lie at (b,0) = (6,0) in the x–z plane; revolving that circle about the z-axis gives the torus. A sphere of radius S = 11 has center on the z-axis, say at (0,C); the sphere’s intersection with the x–z plane is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0,C). If those two circles in the x–z plane are tangent, revolving the tangency point about the z-axis gives the circle of tangency on the torus; its radius equals the x-coordinate of the tangency point.

Write d for the distance between the two centers in the x–z plane. For the two circles to be tangent:
- when the torus is inside the sphere (the big circle contains the small one), d = S − a = 11 − 3 = 8;
- when the torus is outside the sphere (the circles touch externally), d = S + a = 11 + 3 = 14.

The tangency point lies on the line joining the centers. Its x-coordinate r can be obtained by moving from the generating-circle center x = 6 by ±(6)(a/d) (the plus sign when the small circle is inside the big one, the minus sign for external tangency). Thus
- r_i = 6 + 6·(a/d) = 6 + 6·(3/8) = 6 + 18/8 = 33/4,
- r_o = 6 − 6·(a/d) = 6 − 6·(3/14) = 6 − 18/14 = 33/7.

Therefore
r_i − r_o = 33/4 − 33/7 = 33(7 − 4)/28 = 99/28.

So m = 99, n = 28 and m + n = 99 + 28 = 127.

The sign is wrong: the tangency point lies toward the sphere center, so the x-coordinate should be r = 6 − 6·(a/d) (not 6 + 6·(a/d)), meaning the computed r_i = 33/4 is impossible and the final answer is incorrect.

[THOUGHT]
Let f_n be the number of length-n sequences of A's and B's in which every A-run has even length and every B-run has odd length. We want f_14.

Model runs by generating functions. The generating function for an A-run (even positive length) is
a(x) = x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + … = x^2/(1 − x^2).
The generating function for a B-run (odd positive length) is
b(x) = x + x^3 + x^5 + … = x/(1 − x^2).

A valid sequence is either empty, or starts with A and continues alternating (A, B, A, …), or starts with B and alternates. Thus the total generating function is
F(x) = 1 + a(x) + a(x)b(x)a(x) + a(x)b(x)a(x)b(x)a(x) + … + b(x) + b(x)a(x)b(x) + …,
which sums to
F(x) = 1 + a(x)/(1 − b(x)a(x)) + b(x)/(1 − a(x)b(x)) = 1 + (a(x) + b(x)) / (1 − a(x)b(x)).

Compute a(x)+b(x) and a(x)b(x):
a(x) + b(x) = (x^2 + x)/(1 − x^2) = x(1 + x)/(1 − x^2),
a(x)b(x) = x^3/(1 − x^2)^2.

So
F(x) = 1 + (x + x^2 − x^3 − x^4) / ((1 − x^2)^2 − x^3).

Simplifying numerator and denominator gives the rational form
F(x) = (1 + x − x^2 − 2x^3) / (1 − 2x^2 − x^3 + x^4).

Hence the coefficients f_n satisfy the linear recurrence (coming from the denominator)
f_n − 2 f_{n-2} − f_{n-3} + f_{n-4} = 0  for n ≥ 4,
or equivalently
f_n = 2 f_{n-2} + f_{n-3} − f_{n-4}.

f_14 = 2 f_12 + f_11 − f_10 = 2·80 + 49 − 37 = 172.

SOLUTION: 172

[CRITIQUE]
Correct — the generating-function setup, algebra, recurrence, initial values, and resulting computation are valid, so f_14 = 172.

[DECISION]
0","Let f_n be the number of length-n sequences of A's and B's in which every A-run has even length and every B-run has odd length. We want f_14.

Model runs by generating functions. The generating function for an A-run (even positive length) is
a(x) = x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + … = x^2/(1 − x^2).
The generating function for a B-run (odd positive length) is
b(x) = x + x^3 + x^5 + … = x/(1 − x^2).

A valid sequence is either empty, or starts with A and continues alternating (A, B, A, …), or starts with B and alternates. Thus the total generating function is
F(x) = 1 + a(x) + a(x)b(x)a(x) + a(x)b(x)a(x)b(x)a(x) + … + b(x) + b(x)a(x)b(x) + …,
which sums to
F(x) = 1 + a(x)/(1 − b(x)a(x)) + b(x)/(1 − a(x)b(x)) = 1 + (a(x) + b(x)) / (1 − a(x)b(x)).

Compute a(x)+b(x) and a(x)b(x):
a(x) + b(x) = (x^2 + x)/(1 − x^2) = x(1 + x)/(1 − x^2),
a(x)b(x) = x^3/(1 − x^2)^2.

So
F(x) = 1 + (x + x^2 − x^3 − x^4) / ((1 − x^2)^2 − x^3).

Simplifying numerator and denominator gives the rational form
F(x) = (1 + x − x^2 − 2x^3) / (1 − 2x^2 − x^3 + x^4).

Hence the coefficients f_n satisfy the linear recurrence (coming from the denominator)
f_n − 2 f_{n-2} − f_{n-3} + f_{n-4} = 0  for n ≥ 4,
or equivalently
f_n = 2 f_{n-2} + f_{n-3} − f_{n-4}.

Initial values (by inspection):
f_0 = 1 (empty sequence),
f_1 = 1 (only B),
f_2 = 1 (only AA),
f_3 = 3 (AAB, BAA, BBB).

Now compute up to n = 14:
f_4 = 2 f_2 + f_1 − f_0 = 2·1 + 1 − 1 = 2
f_5 = 2 f_3 + f_2 − f_1 = 2·3 + 1 − 1 = 6
f_6 = 2 f_4 + f_3 − f_2 = 2·2 + 3 − 1 = 6
f_7 = 2 f_5 + f_4 − f_3 = 2·6 + 2 − 3 = 11
f_8 = 2 f_6 + f_5 − f_4 = 2·6 + 6 − 2 = 16
f_9 = 2 f_7 + f_6 − f_5 = 2·11 + 6 − 6 = 22
f_10 = 2 f_8 + f_7 − f_6 = 2·16 + 11 − 6 = 37
f_11 = 2 f_9 + f_8 − f_7 = 2·22 + 16 − 11 = 49
f_12 = 2 f_10 + f_9 − f_8 = 2·37 + 22 − 16 = 80
f_13 = 2 f_11 + f_10 − f_9 = 2·49 + 37 − 22 = 113
f_14 = 2 f_12 + f_11 − f_10 = 2·80 + 49 − 37 = 172.

[THOUGHT]
Let x = m + r with m an integer and r in [0,1). Then
floor(2x) + floor(4x) + floor(6x) + floor(8x)
= (2m + floor(2r)) + (4m + floor(4r)) + (6m + floor(6r)) + (8m + floor(8r))
= 20m + F(r),
where F(r) = floor(2r)+floor(4r)+floor(6r)+floor(8r). Thus the possible values are exactly the integers congruent to some value s = F(r) modulo 20.

F(r) depends only on r and changes only when any of 2r,4r,6r,8r passes an integer, i.e. at r = j/24 (j = 0,...,23). So compute s_j = F(j/24) for j = 0,...,23:
s_j = floor(j/12)+floor(j/6)+floor(j/4)+floor(j/3).

Computing these gives:
j = 0,1,2 -> s = 0
j = 3 -> 1
j = 4,5 -> 2
j = 6,7 -> 4
j = 8 -> 5
j = 9,10,11 -> 6

j = 16,17 -> 12
j = 18,19 -> 14
j = 20 -> 15
j = 21,22,23 -> 16

So the distinct residues s (mod 20) that occur are
{0,1,2,4,5,6,10,11,12,14,15,16} — 12 residues in all.

Among the first 1000 positive integers, each residue class modulo 20 appears exactly 50 times (since 1000 = 20·50). Therefore the number of integers in {1,...,1000} that can be written in the given form is 12·50 = 600.

[THOUGHT]
Let the common value be t ≠ 0:
2 log_x(2y) = 2 log_{2x}(4z) = log_{2x^4}(8yz) = t.

From the first equality:
log_x(2y) = t/2 ⇒ 2y = x^{t/2} ⇒ y = (1/2)x^{t/2}.

From the second equality:
log_{2x}(4z) = t/2 ⇒ 4z = (2x)^{t/2} ⇒ z = (1/4)(2x)^{t/2}
= 2^{t/2-2} x^{t/2}.

From the third equality:
8yz = (2x^4)^t = 2^t x^{4t}.

Compute 8yz using the expressions for y and z:
y z = (1/2)x^{t/2} · 2^{t/2-2} x^{t/2} = 2^{t/2-3} x^{t},
so 8 y z = 2^3 · 2^{t/2-3} x^{t} = 2^{t/2} x^{t}.

Equate with the right side:
2^{t/2} x^{t} = 2^t x^{4t} ⇒ 1 = 2^{t/2} x^{3t}.

Thus x^{3t} = 2^{-t/2} ⇒ x = 2^{-1/6} (t cancels because t ≠ 0).

Now
y = (1/2)x^{t/2} = 2^{-1} · 2^{-t/12} = 2^{-1 - t/12},
z = 2^{t/2-2} x^{t/2} = 2^{t/2-2} · 2^{-t/12} = 2^{5t/12 -2}.

Compute xy^5 z:
x y^5 z = 2^{-1/6} · (2^{-1 - t/12})^5 · 2^{5t/12 -2}
= 2^{-1/6} · 2^{-5 -5t/12} · 2^{5t/12 -2}
= 2^{-1/6 -5 -2} = 2^{-43/6} = 1/2^{43/6}.

So p = 43, q = 6 and p+q = 49.

R = 2 n n^T − I = 2(1/5) [[1,2],[2,4]] − I = [[-3/5, 4/5],[4/5, 3/5]].

Since R is its own inverse, a point (x,y) on the reflected curve C* corresponds to (u,v) = R(x,y) on the original curve xy = 1. Thus
u = (−3/5)x + (4/5)y, v = (4/5)x + (3/5)y,

We work modulo 3. Replace each xi by its residue ri = xi (mod 3). The multiset of residues for 1,2,3,4,5 is {0,1,1,2,2} (since 3 ≡ 0, 1 ≡ 1, 4 ≡ 1, 2 ≡ 2, 5 ≡ 2). For a residue sequence r1,...,r5 the sum modulo 3 is

S ≡ r1r2r3 + r2r3r4 + r3r4r5 + r4r5r1 + r5r1r2 (mod 3).

If the 0 is at position 1 (r1 = 0) then three of the five terms vanish, and
S ≡ r2r3r4 + r3r4r5 = r3r4(r2 + r5) (mod 3).
Since r3 and r4 are nonzero (they are 1 or 2), r3r4 ≠ 0 (mod 3), so S ≡ 0 iff r2 + r5 ≡ 0 (mod 3). With residues only 1 or 2, r2 + r5 ≡ 0 iff r2 and r5 are different (one 1 and one 2).

Among positions 2,3,4,5 we must place two 1's and two 2's. There are C(4,2)=6 ways to choose the two positions for the 1's; in exactly 4 of these the entries at positions 2 and 5 are different. So for r1 = 0 there are 4 acceptable residue patterns. By symmetry the same count holds for each of the 5 possible positions of the 0, giving 5·4 = 20 acceptable residue sequences.

Each residue sequence corresponds to 2! ways to assign the actual numbers {1,4} to the two positions labeled 1 and 2! ways to assign {2,5} to the two positions labeled 2, while 3 goes to the 0 position. So each residue pattern yields 2!·2! = 4 distinct permutations of 1..5. Hence the total number of permutations is 20·4 = 80.

SOLUTION: 80

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete, so the conclusion that there are 80 such permutations is valid.

[THOUGHT]
Let z = x + iy. The condition that z/40 has real and imaginary parts in [0,1] is
x/40 ∈ [0,1], y/40 ∈ [0,1], so x,y ∈ [0,40]. Thus z lies in the square S = [0,40] × [0,40].

Next, 40/overline{z} = 40/(x-iy) = 40(x+iy)/(x^2+y^2) has real part 40x/(x^2+y^2) and imaginary part 40y/(x^2+y^2). Requiring each ≤1 gives
40x/(x^2+y^2) ≤ 1 and 40y/(x^2+y^2) ≤ 1.
These rearrange to
x^2 + y^2 ≥ 40x and x^2 + y^2 ≥ 40y,
i.e.
(x-20)^2 + y^2 ≥ 400 and x^2 + (y-20)^2 ≥ 400.

So A is the set of points in the square S that lie outside (or on) both disks of radius 20 centered at C1 = (20,0) and C2 = (0,20). Equivalently,
Area(A) = Area(S) − Area( (disk1 ∪ disk2) ∩ S ).

Each disk ∩ S is exactly a semicircle of radius 20 (the disk centered at (20,0) contributes its upper semicircle inside S, and the other its right semicircle). So
Area(disk1 ∩ S) = Area(disk2 ∩ S) = (1/2)π(20)^2 = 200π.

The intersection of the two disks (which lies entirely inside S) has area given by the standard formula for two equal circles of radius r = 20 separated by d = 20√2:
Area(intersection) = 2 r^2 arccos(d/(2r)) − (d/2) √(4r^2 − d^2).
Here d/(2r) = (20√2)/(40) = √2/2, so arccos = π/4. Compute:
Area(intersection) = 2·400·(π/4) − (10√2)·(20√2) = 200π − 400.

Thus the union area inside the square is
Area((disk1 ∪ disk2) ∩ S) = 200π + 200π − (200π − 400) = 200π + 400.

Therefore
Area(A) = 40^2 − (200π + 400) = 1600 − 200π − 400 = 1200 − 200π.

Numerically, 1200 − 200π ≈ 1200 − 628.31853 = 571.68147, which rounds to 572.

SOLUTION: 572

Correct — the geometry and area computation are valid; the only minor oversight is that z = 0 must be excluded (40/overline{z} is undefined), but removing that single point doesn't change the area, so 572 is correct.

Each brick can be oriented so it contributes $4''\,$ or $10''\,$ or $19''\,$ to the total height of the tower.  How many different tower heights can be achieved using all 94 of the bricks?.

[THOUGHT]
Let x, y, z be the numbers of bricks placed so that the brick contributes 4"", 10"", and 19"" respectively. Then
x + y + z = 94,
and the total height is
H = 4x + 10y + 19z.

Eliminate x by x = 94 − y − z:
H = 4(94 − y − z) + 10y + 19z = 376 + 6y + 15z = 376 + 3(2y + 5z).

So the possible heights are 376 + 3t where t = 2y + 5z ranges over all integers obtainable with nonnegative y, z and y + z ≤ 94. Thus the number of distinct tower heights equals the number of distinct integers t attainable under those constraints.

Set u = y + z (0 ≤ u ≤ 94). Then z ranges 0..u and
t = 2y + 5z = 2(u − z) + 5z = 2u + 3z,
so for each fixed u we obtain the arithmetic progression
t ∈ {2u, 2u+3, 2u+6, …, 5u},
which is the set of u+1 integers from 2u to 5u congruent to 2u (mod 3).

Equivalently, an integer t (0 ≤ t ≤ 470, since max t = 5·94 = 470) is attainable iff there exists an integer u with
ceil(t/5) ≤ u ≤ min(floor(t/2), 94)
and u ≡ 2t (mod 3).

If the interval [ceil(t/5), min(floor(t/2),94)] has length ≥ 3 then it always contains an integer of the required residue class (mod 3), so every such t is attainable. Checking the bounds shows:
- For 0 ≤ t ≤ 188 the interval length ≥ 1, and the only unattainable values are t = 1 and t = 3.
- For 189 ≤ t ≤ 459 the interval length ≥ 3, so all these t are attainable.
- For 460 ≤ t ≤ 470 the interval length is small; checking these individually shows that among 460..470 the unattainable t are 463, 466, 468, and 469.

Thus the unattainable t in 0..470 are exactly {1, 3, 463, 466, 468, 469} — six values. There are 471 integers from 0 to 470 inclusive, so the number of attainable t is 471 − 6 = 465.

Therefore there are 465 distinct tower heights.

SOLUTION: 465

Eliminate x by x = 94 − y − z:
H = 4(94 − y − z) + 10y + 19z = 376 + 6y + 15z = 376 + 3(2y + 5z).

So the possible heights are 376 + 3t where t = 2y + 5z ranges over all integers obtainable with nonnegative y, z and y + z ≤ 94. Thus the number of distinct tower heights equals the number of distinct integers t attainable under those constraints.

Set u = y + z (0 ≤ u ≤ 94). Then z ranges 0..u and

Place C0 at the origin, B at (a,0) and A at (0,b), so the legs are BC0 = a, AC0 = b and the hypotenuse AB = c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). (The given pairwise relatively prime condition means (a,b,c) is a primitive Pythagorean triple.) The foot C1 of the altitude from C0 to AB has coordinates found by projecting the origin to the line bx + ay = ab:
C1 = (ab^2/c^2, a^2 b / c^2).
Thus the first segment length is
C0C1 = h = ab/c.

Now C2 is the foot from C1 to C0B (the x-axis), so C2 = (ab^2/c^2, 0). Hence
C1C2 = vertical drop = a^2 b / c^2.

Compute C3 as the foot from C2 to the line C1B. Writing B − C1 = (a − ab^2/c^2, −a^2 b / c^2) and projecting C2 − C1 = (0, −a^2 b / c^2) onto that direction gives the scalar factor
t = (a^2 b / c^2)^2 / ( (a − ab^2/c^2)^2 + (a^2 b / c^2)^2 ) = b^2 / c^2,
so
C3 has y-coordinate Y3 = Y1(1 − t) = (a^2 b / c^2)(a^2 / c^2) = a^4 b / c^4,
and one finds
C2C3 = a^3 b / c^3.

From these computations we see the pattern (which one checks by the same projection calculation inductively):
the consecutive segment lengths L_m = C_mC_{m+1} satisfy
L_m = a^{m+1} b / c^{m+1} for m = 0,1,2,....
Therefore the required infinite sum is the geometric series
S = sum_{m=0}^\infty L_m = (ab/c) / (1 − a/c) = ab/(c − a).

The problem states S = 6p = 6(a + b + c). Hence
ab/(c − a) = 6(a + b + c).
Multiply both sides and use c^2 = a^2 + b^2 to simplify:
ab = 6(a + b + c)(c − a)
= 6[ac + bc + c^2 − a^2 − ab − ac]
= 6(bc + c^2 − a^2 − ab).

Replace c^2 by a^2 + b^2 to get
ab = 6(bc + b^2 − ab)
⇒ 7ab = 6b(c + b)
⇒ (b > 0) 7a = 6(b + c).

Square both sides after expressing c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), or eliminate c by squaring the linear relation. An easier route: from 7a = 6(b + c) we get 6c = 7a − 6b, so
(7a − 6b)^2 = 36(a^2 + b^2).
Expanding and simplifying gives
13a^2 = 84ab,
so 13a = 84b, hence b = (13/84) a. For integer sides and pairwise coprime, a must be 84, b = 13 (any common scale k would contradict the pairwise coprime condition). Then c = sqrt(84^2 + 13^2) = 85.

From xyz = 1, z = 1/(xy) = 1/((1/5)·24) = 5/24.

[THOUGHT]
Let the circle have radius R and center O. Put OA as a radius and let M be the midpoint of OA. The chord is perpendicular to OA at M, so its distance from the center is d = OM = R/2.

For a chord at distance d from the center the half central angle θ (so the chord subtends angle 2θ at O) satisfies cos θ = d/R. Here cos θ = (R/2)/R = 1/2, so θ = π/3. Thus the two central angles are 2θ = 2π/3 and 2π − 2θ = 4π/3.

The area of the smaller segment (central angle 2π/3) is
A_small = R^2(θ − ½ sin 2θ) = R^2(π/3 − ½ sin(2π/3)) = R^2(π/3 − ½·√3/2) = R^2(π/3 − √3/4).

The larger region is the rest of the circle, so
A_large = πR^2 − A_small = R^2(π − (π/3 − √3/4)) = R^2(2π/3 + √3/4).

The requested ratio (larger : smaller) is
(2π/3 + √3/4) / (π/3 − √3/4).

Multiply numerator and denominator by 12 to clear denominators:
(8π + 3√3) / (4π − 3√3).

Thus in the given form a=8, b=3, c=3, d=4, e=3, f=3. Their product is
abcdef = 8·3·3·4·3·3 = 2592.

The remainder when 2592 is divided by 1000 is 592.

[THOUGHT]
We need the least positive integer Q(m) such that for every integer n ≥ Q(m) there is an integer k with
n < k^3 ≤ m n.

Fix m. For a given k the condition k^3 ≤ m n and n < k^3 is equivalent (for integer n) to
n ∈ [ceil(k^3/m), k^3 − 1].
Thus the integers n that are “covered” (i.e. have some cube in (n, m n]) are exactly the union over k≥1 of the intervals [ceil(k^3/m), k^3 − 1].

Gaps occur between k^3 and (k+1)^3/m when k^3 < (k+1)^3/m. Let K be the largest k for which
(k+1)^3/m > k^3, equivalently m < (1 + 1/k)^3.
For that largest K the right end of the uncovered gap is just below (K+1)^3/m, so the largest uncovered integer is ceil((K+1)^3/m) − 1. Therefore the least Q(m) that guarantees all n ≥ Q(m) are covered is
Q(m) = ceil((K+1)^3/m).

Now (1 + 1/k)^3 is decreasing in k with values
k = 1: 8
k = 2: 3.375
k = 3: 64/27 ≈ 2.37037
k = 4: 1.953125
...
So for given m:
- If m ≥ 8 then no k ≥ 1 satisfies m < (1+1/k)^3, hence K = 0 and Q(m) = ceil(1^3/m) = 1.
- If 4 ≤ m ≤ 7 then only k = 1 satisfies the inequality, so K = 1 and Q(m) = ceil(2^3/m) = ceil(8/m) = 2.
- If m = 3 then k = 1,2 satisfy it, so K = 2 and Q(3) = ceil(3^3/3) = ceil(27/3) = 9.
- If m = 2 then k = 1,2,3 satisfy it, so K = 3 and Q(2) = ceil(4^3/2) = ceil(64/2) = 32.

Thus
Q(2) = 32,
Q(3) = 9,
Q(4) = Q(5) = Q(6) = Q(7) = 2,
and Q(m) = 1 for m = 8, 9, ..., 2017.

Sum them:
sum_{m=2}^{2017} Q(m) = 32 + 9 + 4·2 + (2017 − 7)·1
= 41 + 8 + 2010
= 2059.

Finally 2059 mod 1000 = 59.

Step 1. Setup and key idea
Let ω1 and ω2 be the given circles meeting at X and Y, and let ℓ be the common tangent meeting ω1 at A and ω2 at B. Let ω be the circle through A and B meeting ω1 again at D and ω2 again at C, and suppose C, Y, D are collinear. We are given XC = 67, XY = 47, XD = 37 and asked for AB^2.

The convenient tool here is an inversion centered at X. Choose the inversion with arbitrary radius R; we will pick the radius conveniently later. Under any inversion about X:
- circles through X invert to lines (not passing through X),
- lines not through X invert to circles through X,
- distances along rays from X transform by the usual relation XC · XC' = R^2, etc.

Step 2. Invert about X with radius R chosen so that XC · XD = R^2.
With this choice the points C and D are mutual images: C' = D and D' = C. Also Y maps to a point Y' on the image of the line CD (because C, Y, D are collinear and that line does not pass through X), and Y' satisfies XY · XY' = R^2 = XC · XD.

Under this inversion:
- ω1 and ω2 (each passing through X) become two lines ω1' and ω2'.
- The circle ω (which does not pass through X) becomes some circle ω' that passes through the images of A and B.
- The chord CD of ω becomes the image circle through X that goes through C' = D and D' = C; in particular the image of the line CD is the circle through X,C,D.

Because C and D swap under the inversion, the chord CD of ω becomes a circle through X whose two intersections with ω1' and ω2' are the images of the tangent points A and B. The condition that ℓ is tangent to ω1 at A and to ω2 at B turns, after inversion, into the fact that the images A' and B' lie on ω1' and ω2' respectively and are such that the circle through them meets ω1' and ω2' in a way that makes YA' · YA = (const), etc. Tracking these power relations gives the equality of products of distances from the common intersection point of the three radical axes.

Step 3. Power relations and conclusion
Let P be the radical-center point, the common intersection of the three radical axes AD, BC and XY (so P lies on XY). For P we have, using intersecting-chords/power relations on ω1, ω2 and ω:
PA · PD = PB · PC = PX · PY. (Each product is the power of P with respect to the corresponding circle; since P lies on all three radical axes these powers are equal.)

Now consider the secant through X that hits ω at A and B (i.e. the line through A and B = ℓ). The power of X w.r.t. ω is XA · XB, while the power of X w.r.t. ω computed using the secant through C and D (the line CD) equals XC · XD. Equating the two expressions for Pow(X,ω) after accounting for inversion (or, equivalently, using the choice R^2 = XC · XD above that swaps C and D) yields
XA · XB = XC · XD - XY^2.

Because AB is a chord of ω and XA·XB relates to AB^2 by the chord–tangent/power relations in this configuration, we get
AB^2 = XC · XD - XY^2.

Step 4. Substitute the numbers
XC = 67, XD = 37, XY = 47, so
AB^2 = 67·37 − 47^2 = 2479 − 2209 = 270.

SOLUTION: 270

(a - d)^2 + a^2 + (a + d)^2 = 3a^2 + 2d^2.

3a^2 - d^2 a + 2d^2 = 0.

The discriminant must be a perfect square:
Δ = d^4 - 24 d^2 = d^2(d^2 - 24) must be a perfect square. Set d^2 - 24 = y^2, so

[THOUGHT]
Let P_n = a_n a_{n+1} − 2009. From the recurrence
a_{n+2} = (a_n + 2009)/(1 + a_{n+1}),
we get
a_{n+1} a_{n+2} − 2009 = a_{n+1}*(a_n + 2009)/(1 + a_{n+1}) − 2009
= (a_n a_{n+1} − 2009)/(1 + a_{n+1}),
so
P_{n+1} = P_n/(1 + a_{n+1}).                                         (★)

All a_i are positive integers, so every factor 1 + a_{n+1} ≥ 2. If P_1 ≠ 0, then from (★) the integers |P_n| form a strictly decreasing sequence (each step divides by an integer ≥2), so after finitely many steps |P_n| would fall below 1, impossible unless some P_m = 0. But if P_m = 0 then going backward by P_n = (1 + a_{n+1})P_{n+1} shows P_{m−1} = P_{m−2} = … = P_1 = 0, a contradiction to P_1 ≠ 0. Hence P_1 must be 0.

Thus a1 a2 − 2009 = 0, i.e. a1 a2 = 2009. Factor 2009 = 7^2 · 41, so the positive integer factor pairs are (1,2009), (7,287), (41,49) (and their swaps). The pair minimizing a1 + a2 is (41,49), giving a1 + a2 = 90.

SOLUTION: 90

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete: since P_{n+1}=P_n/(1+a_{n+1}) with integer P_n and 1+a_{n+1}≥2, the only possibility is P_1=0, so a1a2=2009 and the minimal sum is 41+49=90.

Let z(m) denote the number of trailing zeroes of m!, so
z(m) = floor(m/5) + floor(m/25) + floor(m/125) + … .

Observation 1. z(m) is constant on intervals between consecutive multiples of 5 and it increases exactly at multiples of 5. Therefore every positive value of z(m) that actually occurs is equal to z(5k) for some positive integer k, and distinct occurring values correspond one-to-one to k = 1,2,3,…. Hence the number of distinct positive trailing-zero counts ≤ 1991 equals the number of k with z(5k) ≤ 1991.

Compute z(5k). Using the base-5 digit-sum s_5(k) (if k = a_r5^r + … + a_0 with 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 4, define s_5(k)=a_0+…+a_r) we have the identity
sum_{i≥1} floor(k/5^i) = (k - s_5(k))/4.
Therefore
z(5k) = floor(5k/5) + floor(5k/25) + … = k + floor(k/5) + floor(k/25) + … = k + (k - s_5(k))/4 = (5k - s_5(k))/4.

So z(5k) ≤ 1991 ⇔ (5k - s_5(k))/4 ≤ 1991 ⇔ 5k - s_5(k) ≤ 7964 ⇔ 5k ≤ 7964 + s_5(k).

Since 1 ≤ s_5(k) ≤ 4·(number of base-5 digits of k), s_5(k) is relatively small. To find the largest k satisfying the inequality, test around k ≈ 7964/5 = 1592.8.

Compute base-5 digits and s_5(k) for k = 1592,1593,1594,1595,1596:
- 1592 in base 5 is 2·5^4 + 2·5^3 + 3·5^2 + 3·5 + 2, so s_5(1592)=12. Then 5·1592 - 12 = 7960 - 12 = 7948 ≤ 7964.
- 1593 has s_5 = 13 → 5·1593 - 13 = 7952 ≤ 7964.

- 1596 has s_5 = 12 → 5·1596 - 12 = 7980 - 12 = 7968 > 7964.

Thus the largest k with z(5k) ≤ 1991 is k = 1595. Therefore there are 1595 distinct positive integers n ≤ 1991 that occur as the exact number of trailing zeroes of some factorial. Hence the number of positive integers less than 1992 that are NOT factorial tails is

Let N = 20!. Write N = ∏ p_i^{e_i} where p_i are the distinct primes dividing N. If a/b is a reduced fraction with 0<a<b and a·b = N, then gcd(a,b)=1, so for each prime p_i the entire p_i^{e_i} must go to either a or b (it cannot be split). 

The distinct primes ≤20 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, so k = 8. For each of these k primes we have two choices (assign p_i^{e_i} to a or to b), so there are 2^k ordered coprime factor pairs (a,b) with ab = N. None of these pairs has a = b (since N>1 and a,b coprime), so exactly half of these pairs satisfy a<b.

[THOUGHT]
We want the count of distinct positive integers of the form 10^j − 10^i that are divisible by 1001, with 0 ≤ i < j ≤ 99.

1. Factor 1001 = 7·11·13. Since gcd(10,1001)=1, 1001 | (10^j − 10^i) ⇔ 10^i(10^{j−i} − 1) ≡ 0 (mod 1001) ⇔ 10^{j−i} ≡ 1 (mod 1001). Thus the relevant quantity is d = j − i, with 1 ≤ d ≤ 99 and 10^d ≡ 1 (mod 1001).

2. By CRT, the order of 10 modulo 1001 is the lcm of its orders modulo 7, 11, and 13.
   - Mod 7: 10 ≡ 3, and 3^6 ≡ 1, so order 6.
   - Mod 11: 10 ≡ −1, so order 2.
   - Mod 13: 10^6 ≡ 1, so order 6.
   Hence ord_{1001}(10) = lcm(6,2,6) = 6. Therefore 10^d ≡ 1 (mod 1001) exactly when d is a multiple of 6.

3. For each such d (6,12,...,96) we may choose i = 0,1,...,99−d, giving 100 − d possible i values. Different pairs (d,i) give different integers 10^i(10^d − 1) because the exact power of 10 dividing the number is i (and 10^d − 1 is not divisible by 10), so all these values are distinct.

4. Let N = floor(99/6) = 16. The total count is

[THOUGHT]
Let ∠BAC = α and ∠ACP = θ. In triangle APC the three angles are α, θ, 2θ so
α + 3θ = π, hence α = π − 3θ.

Use the Law of Sines in triangle APC. The side opposite α is CP = 1, opposite θ is AP, and opposite 2θ is AC. Thus
1/sin α = AP/sin θ = AC/sin 2θ.
In particular
AP = sin θ / sin α,  AC = sin 2θ / sin α.
Hence
AP/AC = sin θ / sin 2θ = 1/(2 cos θ),
so
AP = AC/(2 cos θ).            (1)

Now apply the Law of Cosines to triangle APC (angle at C is θ):
AP^2 = AC^2 + CP^2 − 2·AC·CP·cos θ = AC^2 + 1 − 2 AC cos θ.
Substitute AP from (1): (AC/(2 cos θ))^2 = AC^2 + 1 − 2 AC cos θ.
Multiply through by 4 cos^2 θ and simplify to get a quadratic in AC:
(4 cos^2 θ − 1) AC^2 − 8 cos^3 θ·AC + 4 cos^2 θ = 0.

Let c = cos θ. Solve this quadratic for AC:
AC = [8 c^3 ± 4 c |2 c^2 − 1|] / [2(4 c^2 − 1)].
Since θ > 45° (because α < 45° implies θ = (π − α)/3 > π/4), we have 2c^2 −1 < 0, so |2c^2 −1| = 1 − 2c^2.
Thus the two roots simplify to AC = 2c and AC = 2c/(4c^2 − 1). The root AC = 2c would give AC/AB = (2c)/4 < 1/2 so α would be > 60°, contradicting α < 45°, so we take
AC = 2c/(4c^2 − 1).

From (1) AP = AC/(2c) = [2c/(4c^2 − 1)]/(2c) = 1/(4c^2 − 1).
Since AB = 4, BP = 4 − AP, and therefore
AP/BP = AP/(4 − AP) = [1/(4c^2 − 1)] / [ (16c^2 −5)/(4c^2 − 1) ] = 1/(16c^2 −5).   (2)

We now use the relation between α and θ. Because α = π − 3θ we have cos α = cos(π − 3θ) = −cos 3θ. But in the right triangle ABC, AC = AB·cos α = 4 cos α = −4 cos 3θ. Equate this to the expression we already have for AC:
−4 cos 3θ = 2c/(4c^2 − 1)  =>  cos 3θ = − c/[2(4c^2 − 1)].

Use the triple-angle identity cos 3θ = 4c^3 − 3c to get
4c^3 − 3c = − c/[2(4c^2 − 1)].
Divide by c (c ≠ 0) and clear denominators:
2(4c^2 − 1)(4c^2 − 3) = −1.
Expand and simplify to obtain a quadratic in y = c^2:
32 y^2 − 32 y + 7 = 0.
Solve:
y = c^2 = (4 ± √2)/8.
Since θ > 45° we need c^2 < 1/2, so choose the minus sign:
c^2 = (4 − √2)/8.

Plug this into (2):
16 c^2 − 5 = 16·((4 − √2)/8) − 5 = 2(4 − √2) − 5 = 3 − 2√2.
Thus
AP/BP = 1/(3 − 2√2) = 3 + 2√2.

So p = 3, q = 2, r = 2 and p + q + r = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

SOLUTION: 7

[CRITIQUE]
The solution is correct and complete — the trigonometric and algebraic steps are valid and yield AP/BP = 3 + 2√2, so p+q+r = 7.

Since θ > 45° (because α < 45° implies θ = (π − α)/3 > π/4), we have 2c^2 −1 < 0, so |2c^2 −1| = 1 − 2c^2.
Thus the two roots simplify to AC = 2c and AC = 2c/(4c^2 − 1). The root AC = 2c would give AC/AB = (2c)/4 < 1/2 so α would be > 60°, contradicting α < 45°, so we take
AC = 2c/(4c^2 − 1).

From (1) AP = AC/(2c) = [2c/(4c^2 − 1)]/(2c) = 1/(4c^2 − 1).
Since AB = 4, BP = 4 − AP, and therefore
AP/BP = AP/(4 − AP) = [1/(4c^2 − 1)] / [ (16c^2 −5)/(4c^2 − 1) ] = 1/(16c^2 −5).   (2)

We now use the relation between α and θ. Because α = π − 3θ we have cos α = cos(π − 3θ) = −cos 3θ. But in the right triangle ABC, AC = AB·cos α = 4 cos α = −4 cos 3θ. Equate this to the expression we already have for AC:
−4 cos 3θ = 2c/(4c^2 − 1)  =>  cos 3θ = − c/[2(4c^2 − 1)].

Use the triple-angle identity cos 3θ = 4c^3 − 3c to get
4c^3 − 3c = − c/[2(4c^2 − 1)].
Divide by c (c ≠ 0) and clear denominators:
2(4c^2 − 1)(4c^2 − 3) = −1.
Expand and simplify to obtain a quadratic in y = c^2:
32 y^2 − 32 y + 7 = 0.
Solve:
y = c^2 = (4 ± √2)/8.
Since θ > 45° we need c^2 < 1/2, so choose the minus sign:
c^2 = (4 − √2)/8.

Plug this into (2):
16 c^2 − 5 = 16·((4 − √2)/8) − 5 = 2(4 − √2) − 5 = 3 − 2√2.
Thus
AP/BP = 1/(3 − 2√2) = 3 + 2√2.

So p = 3, q = 2, r = 2 and p + q + r = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

SOLUTION: 7","The solution is correct and complete — the trigonometric and algebraic steps are valid and yield AP/BP = 3 + 2√2, so p+q+r = 7.",2026-02-22 16:47:12

Let a_n = a r^{n-1}. Then
sum_{n=1}^{12} log_8 a_n = sum_{n=1}^{12} (log_8 a + (n-1) log_8 r)
= 12 log_8 a + (0+1+...+11) log_8 r
= 12 log_8 a + 66 log_8 r = 2006.

Use log_8 x = (log_2 x)/3 to get
12*(log_2 a)/3 + 66*(log_2 r)/3 = 2006
=> 4 log_2 a + 22 log_2 r = 2006
=> 2 log_2 a + 11 log_2 r = 1003.

Rewrite as a^2 r^{11} = 2^{1003}. Hence a^2 r^{11} is a power of 2, so a and r must themselves be powers of 2: a = 2^x, r = 2^y with integers x,y ≥ 0. Substituting gives
2x + 11y = 1003.

Solve the linear Diophantine equation. Mod 11 we get 2x ≡ 2 (mod 11) so x ≡ 1 (mod 11). Write x = 1 + 11t (t an integer). Then
2(1+11t) + 11y = 1003 => 11y + 22t = 1001 => y + 2t = 91 => y = 91 - 2t.

Nonnegativity of x,y with integer t gives t ≥ 0 and 91 - 2t ≥ 0 ⇒ t ≤ 45. Thus t = 0,1,...,45, which yields 46 solutions.

Place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with A = (0,0), B = (4,0), C = (4,3), D = (0,3).  
Divide AB into 168 equal parts: P_k = (4k/168, 0) = (k/42, 0) for k = 0,…,168.  
Divide CB from C to B into 168 equal parts: Q_k = (4, 3(1 − k/168)) = (4, (168 − k)/56) for k = 0,…,168.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 167 the vector from P_k to Q_k is
P_kQ_k = (4 − k/42, (168 − k)/56) = (168 − k)·(1/42, 1/56).

Thus |P_kQ_k| = (168 − k)·|(1/42,1/56)|. The same calculation on AD and CD produces 167 more segments with the same lengths (again (168 − k)·|(1/42,1/56)| for k = 1,…,167). The diagonal AC corresponds to k = 0 and has vector 168·(1/42,1/56) = (4,3).

So the total length is

Let H be the foot of the altitude from C to AB, so CH ⟂ AB. Triangles ACH and BCH are right at H. Let r1 and r2 be the inradii of triangles ACH and BCH, respectively. The points R and S are the touchpoints of those incircles with CH, so HR = r1 and HS = r2. Hence RS = |r1 − r2|.

Let the bases be b1 = log 3 and b2 = log 192, and the altitude h = log 16. In an isosceles trapezoid each leg has length
l = sqrt( h^2 + ((b2 − b1)/2)^2 ).

Compute the horizontal half-difference:
b2 − b1 = log 192 − log 3 = log(192/3) = log 64, so (b2 − b1)/2 = (log 64)/2 = log 8.

Write logs in terms of log 2:
h = log 16 = log 2^4 = 4 log 2, and log 8 = 3 log 2. Thus
l = sqrt((4 log 2)^2 + (3 log 2)^2) = sqrt(25 (log 2)^2) = 5 log 2 = log 32.

Perimeter P = b1 + b2 + 2l = log 3 + log 192 + 2 log 32
= log 3 + log 192 + log 32^2 = log(3 · 192 · 32^2).

0","Let the bases be b1 = log 3 and b2 = log 192, and the altitude h = log 16. In an isosceles trapezoid each leg has length
l = sqrt( h^2 + ((b2 − b1)/2)^2 ).

Compute the horizontal half-difference:
b2 − b1 = log 192 − log 3 = log(192/3) = log 64, so (b2 − b1)/2 = (log 64)/2 = log 8.

Write logs in terms of log 2:
h = log 16 = log 2^4 = 4 log 2, and log 8 = 3 log 2. Thus
l = sqrt((4 log 2)^2 + (3 log 2)^2) = sqrt(25 (log 2)^2) = 5 log 2 = log 32.

Perimeter P = b1 + b2 + 2l = log 3 + log 192 + 2 log 32
= log 3 + log 192 + log 32^2 = log(3 · 192 · 32^2).

Let a = sin^2 x, b = cos^2 x, c = sin x cos x for 0° < x < 90°. Since a + b = 1 and c > 0, the only possible failures of the triangle inequalities are
a ≥ b + c or b ≥ a + c
(because c < a + b = 1 is always true, and symmetry covers both a and b).

By symmetry it suffices to consider x in (0°,45°) where b > a. In this interval the non‑triangle condition is
b ≥ a + c
i.e.
cos^2 x ≥ sin^2 x + sin x cos x.
Divide by cos^2 x (>0):
1 ≥ tan^2 x + tan x,
so tan^2 x + tan x − 1 ≤ 0.
The positive root of tan^2 + tan − 1 = 0 is t = (√5 − 1)/2, so for 0 < x < 45° the inequality holds exactly when
tan x ≤ (√5 − 1)/2.
Hence the measure of x in (0°,90°) for which the three numbers are NOT side lengths is twice arctan((√5 − 1)/2). Thus the probability is
p = (2 · arctan((√5 − 1)/2)) / 90°.

Use the tangent double-angle identity. Let θ = arctan((√5 − 1)/2). Note t = (√5 − 1)/2 satisfies t^2 + t − 1 = 0, so 1 − t^2 = t and
tan(2θ) = 2t/(1 − t^2) = 2t/t = 2.
Thus 2θ = arctan 2, so θ = (1/2) arctan 2 and
p = (2θ)/90° = (arctan 2)/90°.

Comparing with p = d/n where d is the number of degrees in arctan m, we see m = 2 and n = 90, so m + n = 2 + 90 = 92.

[THOUGHT]
Let R(x) denote rounding x to the nearest integer (ties rounded up). For an integer Fahrenheit F we have
C = (5/9)(F − 32), C1 = R(C), F′ = (9/5)C1 + 32, and the final temperature is R(F′). We want integers F in [32,1000] with R(F′) = F.

Write C1 = k (an integer). The condition C1 = k is equivalent to
k − 1/2 ≤ (5/9)(F − 32) < k + 1/2.
Multiplying by 9/5 (positive) gives
32 + (9/5)(k − 1/2) ≤ F < 32 + (9/5)(k + 1/2).
Call this interval A_k. Its center is S_k = 32 + (9/5)k and its half-width is 9/10 = 0.9.

For the final rounding to return F we need
F − 1/2 ≤ (9/5)k + 32 < F + 1/2,
i.e. F must lie in the interval B_k = [S_k − 1/2, S_k + 1/2). Note that B_k has half-width 0.5 and so B_k ⊂ A_k (because 0.5 < 0.9). Therefore, if F ∈ B_k then automatically F ∈ A_k (so the first rounding gives k) and the second rounding gives back F. Thus every integer F contained in some B_k is a fixed point.

Each B_k has length 1 and therefore contains exactly one integer. So each integer k that can occur as C1 produces exactly one integer Fahrenheit F that is fixed. What are the possible k? For F from 32 to 1000 the exact Celsius runs from 0 up to (5/9)(1000−32) = 4840/9 ≈ 537.777…, so k ranges over integers 0,1,2,…,538 (since 537.777… rounds to 538). That is 539 values of k. For k = 0 the corresponding S_k = 32, giving F = 32; for k = 538 we get S_k = 32 + 1.8·538 = 1000.4, giving F = 1000. Hence each of the 539 values k = 0,…,538 produces one distinct integer F in [32,1000] that is fixed.

(There are no tie issues: neither (5/9)(F−32) nor (9/5)k + 32 can be exactly a half-integer for integer F,k, so the half-open interval convention is safe.)

Therefore the number of integer Fahrenheit temperatures between 32 and 1000 inclusive that return to themselves after the two conversions and roundings is 539.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ for which $n^2-19n+99$ is a perfect square..

[THOUGHT]
We want positive integers n for which n^2 − 19n + 99 is a perfect square. Write
n^2 − 19n + 99 = k^2
for some integer k. Consider this as a quadratic in n:
n^2 − 19n + (99 − k^2) = 0.
Its discriminant must be a perfect square:
D = 19^2 − 4(99 − k^2) = 361 − 396 + 4k^2 = 4k^2 − 35 = t^2
for some integer t. Thus
t^2 − 4k^2 = −35, so (t − 2k)(t + 2k) = −35.

The integer factor pairs of −35 (both factors are odd because t is odd) are:
(-1,35), (-5,7), (-7,5), (-35,1).
For each pair (a,b) = (t − 2k, t + 2k) we get
t = (a + b)/2, k = (b − a)/4, and then n = (19 ± t)/2.

Compute each:
- (a,b)=(-1,35): t=17, k=9 ⇒ n=(19±17)/2 gives n=18 or n=1.
- (a,b)=(-5,7): t=1, k=3 ⇒ n=(19±1)/2 gives n=10 or n=9.
(The other two pairs give the same t with opposite sign.)

Thus the positive integer solutions are n = 1, 9, 10, 18. Their sum is 1+9+10+18 = 38.

[THOUGHT]
Let Rudolph's biking rate be R miles per minute. Jennifer's rate is (3/4)R.

Rudolph rides 50 miles. He stops for a 5-minute break at the end of every mile, but the break at the 50th mile occurs after arrival and does not affect arrival time. So Rudolph takes 49 breaks. His total time:
T = riding time + break time = 50/R + 49·5 = 50/R + 245.

Jennifer rides 50 miles at speed (3/4)R. She stops 5 minutes at the end of every 2 miles; the break at mile 50 (end of the trip) does not affect arrival, so she stops after miles 2,4,…,48 — that is 24 breaks. Her total time:
T = 50 / ((3/4)R) + 24·5 = (200/3)/R + 120.

They arrive together, so
50/R + 245 = (200/3)/R + 120.

Subtract 120 and bring R-terms together:
125 = (200/3 − 50)/R = (50/3)/R.

Thus (50/3)/R = 125 ⇒ R = (50/3)/125 = 50/(375) = 2/15 miles per minute.

Now compute the common time:
T = 50/R + 245 = 50 ÷ (2/15) + 245 = 375 + 245 = 620 minutes.

[THOUGHT]
Step 1. Angles subtended by BD and CD at the two incenters.
In triangle ABD the incenter I_B satisfies the standard formula for an incenter: the angle subtended by the other two vertices at the incenter is 90° plus half the remaining vertex angle. Thus
∠B I_B D = 90° + (∠BAD)/2.
Similarly, in triangle ACD,
∠C I_C D = 90° + (∠CAD)/2.
Since ∠BAD + ∠CAD = ∠BAC = ∠A, adding gives
∠B I_B D + ∠C I_C D = 180° + ∠A/2.

Step 2. Relate those to angles at P.
Because B, I_B, D, P are concyclic, the inscribed angle theorem gives ∠BPD = ∠B I_B D. Likewise ∠CPD = ∠C I_C D. If ∠BPD + ∠CPD > 180° then the smaller angle ∠BPC equals 360° − (∠BPD + ∠CPD). Thus
∠BPC = 360° − (∠B I_B D + ∠C I_C D) = 360° − (180° + ∠A/2) = 180° − ∠A/2.
So the angle at P in triangle BPC is constant (independent of D): ∠BPC = 180° − A/2.

Step 3. Maximize area of triangle BPC with fixed BC and fixed vertex angle at P.
Let BC = a (here a = 14) and let θ = ∠BPC = 180° − A/2. The circumradius R of triangle BPC is determined by a and θ:
a = 2R sin θ  ⇒  R = a/(2 sin θ).
The area K of triangle BPC can be written as
K = (1/2) PB·PC · sin θ.
By the law of sines in triangle BPC, PB = 2R sin∠C and PC = 2R sin∠B, and ∠B + ∠C = 180° − θ = A/2 is fixed. For fixed sum s = ∠B + ∠C, the product sin∠B · sin∠C is maximized when ∠B = ∠C = s/2. Hence the area is maximized when ∠B = ∠C = A/4 (i.e. PB = PC), and the maximal area is
K_max = (1/2)(PB)^2 sin θ = (1/2)(2R sin(A/4))^2 sin θ = 2R^2 sin^2(A/4) sin θ.
Replace R = a/(2 sin θ):
K_max = 2 (a^2/(4 sin^2 θ)) sin^2(A/4) sin θ = (a^2/2) · sin^2(A/4) / sin θ.

Use sin θ = sin(A/2) and sin(A/2) = 2 sin(A/4) cos(A/4). Thus
sin^2(A/4) / sin(A/2) = sin(A/4)/(2 cos(A/4)) = (1/2) tan(A/4),
so
K_max = (a^2/2) · (1/2) tan(A/4) = (a^2/4) tan(A/4).

Step 4. Compute A and the numerical value.
From the side lengths AB = 10, BC = 14, CA = 16 we get (by the law of cosines)
cos A = (16^2 + 10^2 − 14^2)/(2·16·10) = (256 + 100 − 196)/320 = 160/320 = 1/2,
so A = 60°. Therefore A/4 = 15° and tan 15° = 2 − √3. With a = BC = 14,
K_max = (14^2/4) tan 15° = 49 · (2 − √3) = 98 − 49√3.

This is of the form a − b√c with a = 98, b = 49, c = 3, so a + b + c = 98 + 49 + 3 = 150.

The flaw is in Step 2: the author assumes without justification that ∠BPD + ∠CPD > 180° and therefore takes ∠BPC = 360° − (∠BPD + ∠CPD) = 180° − A/2, whereas the actual smaller angle ∠BPC could instead be (∠BPD + ∠CPD) − 180° = A/2, so the choice of which supplementary/reflex angle to use is unjustified and may be wrong.

0","Step 1. Angles subtended by BD and CD at the two incenters.
In triangle ABD the incenter I_B satisfies the standard formula for an incenter: the angle subtended by the other two vertices at the incenter is 90° plus half the remaining vertex angle. Thus
∠B I_B D = 90° + (∠BAD)/2.
Similarly, in triangle ACD,
∠C I_C D = 90° + (∠CAD)/2.
Since ∠BAD + ∠CAD = ∠BAC = ∠A, adding gives
∠B I_B D + ∠C I_C D = 180° + ∠A/2.

Step 2. Relate those to angles at P.
Because B, I_B, D, P are concyclic, the inscribed angle theorem gives ∠BPD = ∠B I_B D. Likewise ∠CPD = ∠C I_C D. If ∠BPD + ∠CPD > 180° then the smaller angle ∠BPC equals 360° − (∠BPD + ∠CPD). Thus
∠BPC = 360° − (∠B I_B D + ∠C I_C D) = 360° − (180° + ∠A/2) = 180° − ∠A/2.
So the angle at P in triangle BPC is constant (independent of D): ∠BPC = 180° − A/2.

Step 3. Maximize area of triangle BPC with fixed BC and fixed vertex angle at P.
Let BC = a (here a = 14) and let θ = ∠BPC = 180° − A/2. The circumradius R of triangle BPC is determined by a and θ:
a = 2R sin θ  ⇒  R = a/(2 sin θ).
The area K of triangle BPC can be written as
K = (1/2) PB·PC · sin θ.
By the law of sines in triangle BPC, PB = 2R sin∠C and PC = 2R sin∠B, and ∠B + ∠C = 180° − θ = A/2 is fixed. For fixed sum s = ∠B + ∠C, the product sin∠B · sin∠C is maximized when ∠B = ∠C = s/2. Hence the area is maximized when ∠B = ∠C = A/4 (i.e. PB = PC), and the maximal area is
K_max = (1/2)(PB)^2 sin θ = (1/2)(2R sin(A/4))^2 sin θ = 2R^2 sin^2(A/4) sin θ.
Replace R = a/(2 sin θ):
K_max = 2 (a^2/(4 sin^2 θ)) sin^2(A/4) sin θ = (a^2/2) · sin^2(A/4) / sin θ.

Use sin θ = sin(A/2) and sin(A/2) = 2 sin(A/4) cos(A/4). Thus
sin^2(A/4) / sin(A/2) = sin(A/4)/(2 cos(A/4)) = (1/2) tan(A/4),
so
K_max = (a^2/2) · (1/2) tan(A/4) = (a^2/4) tan(A/4).

Step 4. Compute A and the numerical value.
From the side lengths AB = 10, BC = 14, CA = 16 we get (by the law of cosines)
cos A = (16^2 + 10^2 − 14^2)/(2·16·10) = (256 + 100 − 196)/320 = 160/320 = 1/2,
so A = 60°. Therefore A/4 = 15° and tan 15° = 2 − √3. With a = BC = 14,
K_max = (14^2/4) tan 15° = 49 · (2 − √3) = 98 − 49√3.

This is of the form a − b√c with a = 98, b = 49, c = 3, so a + b + c = 98 + 49 + 3 = 150.

[THOUGHT]
Let the cubic be 8x^3 + 0x^2 + 1001x + 2008 = 0 with roots r,s,t.

By Vieta:
- r + s + t = 0,
- rs + rt + st = 1001/8,
- rst = -2008/8 = -251.

Since r + s + t = 0, we have r + s = -t, s + t = -r, t + r = -s. Thus
(r + s)^3 + (s + t)^3 + (t + r)^3 = -t^3 - r^3 - s^3 = -(r^3 + s^3 + t^3).

Compute r^3 + s^3 + t^3 using the identity
r^3 + s^3 + t^3 = (r + s + t)^3 - 3(r + s + t)(rs + rt + st) + 3rst.
With r + s + t = 0 this simplifies to r^3 + s^3 + t^3 = 3rst = 3(−251) = −753.

Therefore the desired sum is −(−753) = 753.

What does the biologist calculate for the number of fish in the lake on May 1?.

[THOUGHT]
Let N = number of fish in the lake on May 1. She tags 60 of them.

1. By September 1, 25% of the May 1 fish are gone, so 75% remain. Number of May 1 fish remaining = 0.75 N.
2. The September 1 population M consists of 60% fish that were present on May 1 and 40% new fish. Thus 0.6 M = number of May 1 fish remaining. So
   0.6 M = 0.75 N ⇒ M = (0.75/0.6) N = 1.25 N.
3. Tagged fish surviving to September 1 = 0.75 × 60 = 45.
4. In the September 1 sample of 70 fish, 3 are tagged, so the fraction tagged in the population is 3/70. Set this equal to the population fraction of tagged fish:
   45 / M = 3 / 70 ⇒ M = 45 × 70 / 3 = 15 × 70 = 1050.

W1 = S - (m/n)S = ((n - m)/n)S.

If he had purchased half as much, the size would be S/2, and if he drank twice as much (twice the original amount), he would drink 2(m/n)S. The waste then would be
W2 = S/2 - 2(m/n)S = S*(1/2 - 2m/n) = S*(n - 4m)/(2n).

We are told W2 = (2/9)W1, so
S*(n - 4m)/(2n) = (2/9)*S*(n - m)/n.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Anh read a book. On the first day she read $n$ pages in $t$ minutes, where $n$ and $t$ are positive integers. On the second day Anh read $n + 1$ pages in $t + 1$ minutes. Each day thereafter Anh read one more page than she read on the previous day, and it took her one more minute than on the previous day until she completely read the $374$ page book. It took her a total of $319$ minutes to read the book. Find $n + t$ ..

[THOUGHT]
Let k be the number of days. Pages per day: n, n+1, ..., n+k-1. Minutes per day: t, t+1, ..., t+k-1.

Sum of pages:
k n + k(k-1)/2 = 374.    (1)

Sum of minutes:
k t + k(k-1)/2 = 319.    (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
k(n - t) = 374 - 319 = 55.    (3)

Since k, n, t are positive integers and there is a second day, k ≥ 2. From (3), k is a divisor of 55 greater than 1, so k ∈ {5,11,55}.

Test k = 5:
5t + 5·4/2 = 319 ⇒ 5t + 10 = 319 ⇒ t = 309/5, not an integer → reject.

Test k = 11:
11t + 11·10/2 = 319 ⇒ 11t + 55 = 319 ⇒ 11t = 264 ⇒ t = 24.
From (3): n - t = 55/11 = 5 ⇒ n = 29.
Check pages: 11·29 + 55 = 319 + 55 = 374, OK.

Test k = 55:
55t + 55·54/2 = 319 ⇒ 55t + 1485 = 319 ⇒ 55t negative ⇒ impossible.

Thus the valid solution is n = 29 and t = 24, so n + t = 53.

SOLUTION: 53

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is correct and complete: from k(n−t)=55 the divisor cases k∈{5,11,55} are tested and only k=11 yields integer t=24 and n=29, so n+t=53.

Place A = (0,0), B = (8,0), and choose C = (0,4) so that AC = 4 and AB = 8. Then E on AC with AE = 3 (CE = 1) is E = (0,3). Point D on BC with BD = 5, DC = 2 divides BC in the ratio 5:2, so
D = (2/7)B + (5/7)C = (16/7,20/7).

Line AD has slope (20/7)/(16/7) = 5/4, so AD: y = (5/4)x.
Line BE passes through B(8,0) and E(0,3), slope −3/8, so BE: y = −3/8 x + 3.

Their intersection P satisfies (5/4)x = −3/8 x + 3, so (13/8)x = 3 ⇒ x = 24/13, and y = (5/4)x = 30/13. Thus P = (24/13,30/13).

PQ is parallel to CA. Since CA is vertical (x = 0), PQ is the vertical line x = 24/13, meeting AB (y = 0) at Q = (24/13,0).
PR is parallel to CB; CB has slope (0−4)/(8−0) = −1/2, so PR has slope −1/2. Intersecting PR with AB (y = 0):
0 − 30/13 = −1/2 (x − 24/13) ⇒ x = 84/13, so R = (84/13,0).

Base QR has length 84/13 − 24/13 = 60/13, and the height from P to AB is y_P = 30/13. Hence
area(PQR) = (1/2)·(60/13)·(30/13) = 900/169.

Area(ABC) = (1/2)·AB·(height from C to AB) = (1/2)·8·4 = 16.

So the ratio = (900/169)/16 = 900/(169·16) = 225/676. Thus m = 225, n = 676, and m + n = 901.

[THOUGHT]
Let R be the circle’s radius. For a central angle θ the chord length is 2R sin(θ/2). So
2R sin(α/2) = 2, 2R sin(β/2) = 3, 2R sin((α+β)/2) = 4.
Divide by 2R and set c = cos(α/2), d = cos(β/2). Then
sin(α/2) = 1/R, sin(β/2) = 3/(2R), sin((α+β)/2) = 2/R.
Using the sine addition formula:
sin((α+β)/2) = sin(α/2) cos(β/2) + cos(α/2) sin(β/2)
gives
(1/R)d + (3/(2R))c = 2/R,
so
d + (3/2)c = 2.        (1)

Also c^2 = 1 − 1/R^2 and d^2 = 1 − 9/(4R^2). Square (1):
d^2 = 4 − 6c + (9/4)c^2.
Substitute the expressions for d^2 and c^2 in terms of 1/R^2 (call t = 1/R^2):
1 − (9/4)t = 4 − 6c + (9/4)(1 − t).
The −(9/4)t terms cancel, leaving
1 = 25/4 − 6c  ⇒  6c = 21/4  ⇒  c = 7/8.

Then cos α = 2 cos^2(α/2) − 1 = 2(7/8)^2 − 1 = 2(49/64) − 1 = 17/32.
This fraction is in lowest terms; numerator + denominator = 17 + 32 = 49.

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Ana, Bob, and Cao bike at constant rates of $8.6$ meters per second, $6.2$ meters per second, and $5$ meters per second, respectively.

Find $p+q+r$ ..

[THOUGHT]
Place the northeast corner at the origin, let x increase westward and y increase southward. Let the field's longer side (length) be L and the width be W. The southeast corner is then at (0,W). Let point D on the south edge have coordinates (d,W) (so the distance from D to the southeast corner is d).

Ana bikes along the perimeter starting west, Bob along the perimeter starting south, and Cao goes straight to D. Their path-lengths to D are:
- Ana: s_A = (top edge to NW) L + (west edge down) W + (bottom edge back east to D) (L − d) = 2L + W − d.
- Bob: s_B = (east edge down) W + (bottom edge to D) d = W + d.
- Cao: s_C = straight line = sqrt(d^2 + W^2).

Since they arrive at the same time and bike at constant speeds v_A = 8.6, v_B = 6.2, v_C = 5, the distances are proportional to speeds:
s_A : s_B : s_C = 8.6 : 6.2 : 5 = 86 : 62 : 50 = 43 : 31 : 25.

So for some λ > 0,
s_A = 43λ, s_B = 31λ, s_C = 25λ.

From s_B: W + d = 31λ, so d = 31λ − W.
From s_A: 2L + W − d = 43λ ⇒ 2L + 2W = 74λ ⇒ L + W = 37λ ⇒ L = 37λ − W.
From s_C: d^2 + W^2 = (25λ)^2. Substitute d = 31λ − W:
(31λ − W)^2 + W^2 = 625λ^2
⇒ 961λ^2 − 62λW + 2W^2 = 625λ^2
⇒ 2W^2 − 62λW + 336λ^2 = 0
⇒ W^2 − 31λW + 168λ^2 = 0.

Solve this quadratic: discriminant = 31^2λ^2 − 4·168λ^2 = 289λ^2 = (17λ)^2, so
W = [31λ ± 17λ]/2, giving W = 24λ or W = 7λ.

Since L = 37λ − W must be the longer side, choose W = 7λ, giving L = 30λ and d = 31λ − 7λ = 24λ.

Thus the ratio length : width : distance from D to southeast corner is
L : W : d = 30λ : 7λ : 24λ = 30 : 7 : 24.

So p + q + r = 30 + 7 + 24 = 61.

PROBLEM: You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: Ana, Bob, and Cao bike at constant rates of $8.6$ meters per second, $6.2$ meters per second, and $5$ meters per second, respectively. They all begin biking at the same time from the northeast corner of a rectangular field whose longer side runs due west. Ana starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading west, Bob starts biking along the edge of the field, initially heading south, and Cao bikes in a straight line across the field to a point $D$ on the south edge of the field. Cao arrives at point $D$ at the same time that Ana and Bob arrive at $D$ for the first time. The ratio of the field's length to the field's width to the distance from point $D$ to the southeast corner of the field can be represented as $p : q : r$ , where $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ are positive integers with $p$ and $q$ relatively prime. Find $p+q+r$ ..
SOLUTION AND REASONING: Place the northeast corner at the origin, let x increase westward and y increase southward. Let the field's longer side (length) be L and the width be W. The southeast corner is then at (0,W). Let point D on the south edge have coordinates (d,W) (so the distance from D to the southeast corner is d).

Ana bikes along the perimeter starting west, Bob along the perimeter starting south, and Cao goes straight to D. Their path-lengths to D are:
- Ana: s_A = (top edge to NW) L + (west edge down) W + (bottom edge back east to D) (L − d) = 2L + W − d.
- Bob: s_B = (east edge down) W + (bottom edge to D) d = W + d.
- Cao: s_C = straight line = sqrt(d^2 + W^2).

Since they arrive at the same time and bike at constant speeds v_A = 8.6, v_B = 6.2, v_C = 5, the distances are proportional to speeds:
s_A : s_B : s_C = 8.6 : 6.2 : 5 = 86 : 62 : 50 = 43 : 31 : 25.

So for some λ > 0,
s_A = 43λ, s_B = 31λ, s_C = 25λ.

From s_B: W + d = 31λ, so d = 31λ − W.
From s_A: 2L + W − d = 43λ ⇒ 2L + 2W = 74λ ⇒ L + W = 37λ ⇒ L = 37λ − W.
From s_C: d^2 + W^2 = (25λ)^2. Substitute d = 31λ − W:
(31λ − W)^2 + W^2 = 625λ^2
⇒ 961λ^2 − 62λW + 2W^2 = 625λ^2
⇒ 2W^2 − 62λW + 336λ^2 = 0
⇒ W^2 − 31λW + 168λ^2 = 0.

Solve this quadratic: discriminant = 31^2λ^2 − 4·168λ^2 = 289λ^2 = (17λ)^2, so
W = [31λ ± 17λ]/2, giving W = 24λ or W = 7λ.

Since L = 37λ − W must be the longer side, choose W = 7λ, giving L = 30λ and d = 31λ − 7λ = 24λ.

Thus the ratio length : width : distance from D to southeast corner is
L : W : d = 30λ : 7λ : 24λ = 30 : 7 : 24.

So p + q + r = 30 + 7 + 24 = 61.

SOLUTION: 61

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: The graph of the equation $9x+223y=2007$ is drawn on graph paper with each square representing one unit in each direction. How many of the $1$ by $1$ graph paper squares have interiors lying entirely below the graph and entirely in the first quadrant ?.

[THOUGHT]
We want the number of unit squares with lower-left corner at integer (i,j) with i,j ≥ 0 whose entire interior lies below the line 9x + 223y = 2007. For the interior of the square (i,i+1)×(j,j+1) to be entirely below the line it suffices that the top edge y = j+1 is never above the line on the interval x ∈ (i,i+1). Because the line is decreasing, the minimum of the right-hand side on that interval occurs at x = i+1, so the condition is

(2007 − 9(i+1))/223 ≥ j+1.

Multiplying through and simplifying gives the equivalent integer inequality

9i + 223j ≤ 1775.

Thus we need the number of nonnegative integer solutions (i,j) to 9i + 223j ≤ 1775. It is convenient to sum over j = 0,1,…,7 (since 223·8 > 1775):

For each j, the allowable i are 0 ≤ i ≤ floor((1775 − 223j)/9), so the number of i for that j is floor((1775 − 223j)/9) + 1. Compute:

j = 0: floor(1775/9)+1 = 197+1 = 198  
j = 1: floor(1552/9)+1 = 172+1 = 173  
j = 2: floor(1329/9)+1 = 147+1 = 148  
j = 3: floor(1106/9)+1 = 122+1 = 123  
j = 4: floor(883/9)+1 = 98+1 = 99  
j = 5: floor(660/9)+1 = 73+1 = 74  
j = 6: floor(437/9)+1 = 48+1 = 49  
j = 7: floor(214/9)+1 = 23+1 = 24

Summing these counts: 198+173+148+123+99+74+49+24 = 888.

The reasoning is correct and the final count 888 is right (note the subtlety that equality at x = i+1 is allowed because the square's interior uses x < i+1, so the condition 9i+223j ≤ 1775 is valid).

What is the absolute value of the slope of this line?.

[THOUGHT]
Let the line pass through P = (17,76). For a circle of radius r whose center is at distance d (signed) from the line, the difference between the areas on the two sides of the line is an odd function f(d) (f(0)=0, f(−d)=−f(d)); in particular f depends only on the signed distance from the center to the line. Because the three circles have the same radius, the total signed area difference is f(d1)+f(d2)+f(d3), where di are signed distances of the three centers to the line. The center at P has d2 = 0 so its contribution is 0; for the total to be 0 we need f(d1)+f(d3)=0, hence f(d1)=−f(d3). Since f is odd and strictly monotone in the relevant range, this implies d1 = −d3.

If n is a unit normal to the line, di = n · (Ci − P). Thus
n · (C1 − P) + n · (C3 − P) = n · (C1 + C3 − 2P) = 0,
so n is perpendicular to the vector V = C1 + C3 − 2P. Therefore the line’s direction is parallel to V.

Compute V: C1 = (14,92), C3 = (19,84), P = (17,76),
V = C1 + C3 − 2P = (14+19−34, 92+84−152) = (−1,24).

Thus the line’s slope equals 24/(−1) = −24, and the absolute value of the slope is 24.

SOLUTION: 24

[CRITIQUE]
The argument wrongly assumes f is strictly monotone so f(d1)=−f(d3) implies d1=−d3; in fact f(d) (the signed area difference) is constant ±πr^2 for |d|≥r, so equal-and-opposite values can occur without the distances having equal magnitude.
