SOLUTION: 17

Step 1: Let t = log_2 x. Then x = 2^t, and
- log_2 x = t
- log_4 x = t/2
- log_8(2x) = log_2(2x)/log_2 8 = (1 + t)/3

So A = (t+1)/3, B = t/2, C = t. For a geometric progression, B^2 = A C.

Step 2: Solve B^2 = A C:
(t/2)^2 = [(t+1)/3]·t
t^2/4 = t(t+1)/3

If t ≠ 0, divide both sides by t:
t/4 = (t+1)/3 → 3t = 4t + 4 → t = -4.

(We discard t = 0 since that would give a common ratio r = 0, not positive.)

Step 3: Check r > 0 and consistency:
For t = -4, A = (t+1)/3 = (-3)/3 = -1, B = t/2 = -2, C = t = -4.
r = B/A = (-2)/(-1) = 2 > 0, and B = Ar, C = Br, so it’s a GP with positive ratio.

Step 4: Find x:
x = 2^t = 2^{-4} = 1/16. Thus x = m/n = 1/16, with m+n = 1 + 16 = 17.

[CRITIQUE]
The solution is correct: introducing t = log2 x and using B^2 = AC gives t = -4 (the case t = 0 would yield r = 0, not positive), hence x = 2^{-4} = 1/16 and m + n = 17.

Step 1: Let the arithmetic sequence have first term a, common difference d, and n terms. Its sum is S = n/2 [2a + (n−1)d] = 715.

Step 2: After increasing the k-th term by the k-th odd number (2k−1), the new sum is S' = S + sum_{k=1}^n (2k−1) = S + n^2. Given S' = 836, so n^2 = 836 − 715 = 121, hence n = 11.

Step 3: With n = 11, 715 = 11/2 [2a + 10d] ⇒ 2a + 10d = 130 ⇒ a + 5d = 65.

Step 4: The middle term (k = 6 for n = 11) is a_6 = a + 5d = 65. So the middle term is 65.

Step 5: The sum of the first and last terms: a_1 + a_11 = a + (a + 10d) = 2a + 10d = 2(a + 5d) = 130.

Step 1: Let P = (x, y) be a random point in the unit square, and Q = (5/8, 3/8). The slope of line PQ is
m = (y − 3/8) / (x − 5/8).

We want m ≥ 1/2. Since the sign of x − 5/8 matters, handle two cases.

Step 2: Case x > 5/8. Then x − 5/8 > 0, so
y − 3/8 ≥ (1/2)(x − 5/8) ⇒ y ≥ 3/8 + (1/2)(x − 5/8) = (1/16) + (1/2)x.

Step 3: Case x < 5/8. Then x − 5/8 < 0, so the inequality reverses:
y − 3/8 ≤ (1/2)(x − 5/8) ⇒ y ≤ 3/8 + (1/2)(x − 5/8) = (1/16) + (1/2)x.

Thus the region in the square is:
- For x ≥ 5/8: y ≥ (1/2)x + 1/16.
- For x ≤ 5/8: y ≤ (1/2)x + 1/16.

Let L be the line y = (1/2)x + 1/16.

Step 4: Compute the area of these regions inside the unit square.

A1 (x from 5/8 to 1): area above L

[THOUGHT]
Step 1: Define F(x) = P(x) - x - 3. Since P has integer coefficients, F also has integer coefficients, and F(n) = 0 exactly for the integer roots n1, n2 of P(n) = n + 3.

Step 2: Use the given values at 17 and 24:
- F(17) = P(17) - 17 - 3 = 10 - 20 = -10
- F(24) = P(24) - 24 - 3 = 17 - 27 = -10

Step 3: Let H(x) = F(x) + 10 = P(x) - x + 7. Then H(17) = H(24) = 0, so (x - 17) and (x - 24) are factors of H(x). Since H has integer coefficients, we can write
H(x) = (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x)
for some T(x) with integer coefficients. Therefore
P(x) = x - 7 + (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x).

Step 4: Express F(x) using this form:
F(x) = P(x) - x - 3 = -10 + (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x).

Step 5: Since n1 and n2 are roots of F, we have
-10 + (n - 17)(n - 24) T(n) = 0
=> (n - 17)(n - 24) T(n) = 10.

Let A(n) = (n - 17)(n - 24). Then A(n) must be a divisor of 10 for any integer root n, i.e., A(n) ∈ {±1, ±2, ±5, ±10}.

Step 6: Solve A(n) ∈ {±1, ±2, ±5, ±10}. Since A(n) = (n - 17)(n - 24) = n^2 - 41n + 408, set A(n) = d and solve:
n^2 - 41n + 408 = d
Discriminant Δ = 41^2 - 4(408 - d) = 1681 - 1632 + 4d = 49 + 4d.

Check which d give a perfect square Δ:
- d = -10 gives Δ = 49 - 40 = 9, so n = (41 ± 3)/2 = 22 or 19.
- For all other d in {±1, ±2, ±5, 10}, Δ is not a perfect square, so no integer n.

Thus the only possible integer roots are n1 = 19 and n2 = 22, which are indeed distinct.

Step 7: The product n1 n2 = 19 × 22 = 418.

SOLUTION: 418

[CRITIQUE]
Correct and concise: once you set F(x)=P(x)-x-3, note F(17)=F(24)=-10, so H(x)=F(x)+10 is divisible by (x-17)(x-24); since F(n)=0 implies (n-17)(n-24)T(n)=10 with T(n) integer, (n-17)(n-24) must divide 10, which yields n=19 or 22, giving n1n2=418.

- F(17) = P(17) - 17 - 3 = 10 - 20 = -10
- F(24) = P(24) - 24 - 3 = 17 - 27 = -10

Step 3: Let H(x) = F(x) + 10 = P(x) - x + 7. Then H(17) = H(24) = 0, so (x - 17) and (x - 24) are factors of H(x). Since H has integer coefficients, we can write
H(x) = (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x)
for some T(x) with integer coefficients. Therefore
P(x) = x - 7 + (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x).

Step 4: Express F(x) using this form:
F(x) = P(x) - x - 3 = -10 + (x - 17)(x - 24) T(x).

Step 5: Since n1 and n2 are roots of F, we have
-10 + (n - 17)(n - 24) T(n) = 0
=> (n - 17)(n - 24) T(n) = 10.

Let A(n) = (n - 17)(n - 24). Then A(n) must be a divisor of 10 for any integer root n, i.e., A(n) ∈ {±1, ±2, ±5, ±10}.

Step 6: Solve A(n) ∈ {±1, ±2, ±5, ±10}. Since A(n) = (n - 17)(n - 24) = n^2 - 41n + 408, set A(n) = d and solve:
n^2 - 41n + 408 = d
Discriminant Δ = 41^2 - 4(408 - d) = 1681 - 1632 + 4d = 49 + 4d.

Check which d give a perfect square Δ:
- d = -10 gives Δ = 49 - 40 = 9, so n = (41 ± 3)/2 = 22 or 19.
- For all other d in {±1, ±2, ±5, 10}, Δ is not a perfect square, so no integer n.

Thus the only possible integer roots are n1 = 19 and n2 = 22, which are indeed distinct.

Step 7: The product n1 n2 = 19 × 22 = 418.

SOLUTION: 418
CRITIQUE: Correct and concise: once you set F(x)=P(x)-x-3, note F(17)=F(24)=-10, so H(x)=F(x)+10 is divisible by (x-17)(x-24); since F(n)=0 implies (n-17)(n-24)T(n)=10 with T(n) integer, (n-17)(n-24) must divide 10, which yields n=19 or 22, giving n1n2=418.

Step-by-step:
- Let the bottom row be b1, b2, ..., b11 with each bi ∈ {0,1}. The top value is
  T = sum_{j=1}^{11} C(10, j-1) b_j (modulo 3), since each square above is the sum of the two below.
- Compute C(10, k) modulo 3 using Lucas’ theorem. With 10 in base 3 as 101, the only k for which C(10,k) ≡ 1 (mod 3) are k = 0,1,9,10. Thus the only bottom entries that affect T modulo 3 are b1, b2, b10, b11, and
  T ≡ b1 + b2 + b10 + b11 (mod 3).
- We want T ≡ 0 (mod 3). So s = b1 + b2 + b10 + b11 must be 0 or 3 (since s ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}).
  - If s = 0: b1 = b2 = b10 = b11 = 0. The remaining seven bottom entries can be anything: 2^7 = 128 possibilities.
  - If s = 3: exactly three of {b1,b2,b10,b11} are 1. There are C(4,3) = 4 choices for which three are 1, and the remaining seven bits are free: 4 * 2^7 = 512.

Step 1: Interpret the condition
We count 10-letter strings over {A, B} with no run of identical letters longer than 3. Equivalently, every run of consecutive identical letters has length 1, 2, or 3.

Step 2: Set up states
Let C_n(r) be the number of length-n strings that end with a run of length r of a fixed letter, say A. Here r ∈ {1, 2, 3}. By symmetry, the same counts apply for runs of B, so the total number of valid strings of length n is T_n = 2 * (C_n(1) + C_n(2) + C_n(3)).

PROBLEM: You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: There are $2^{10} = 1024$ possible $10$ -letter strings in which each letter is either an A or a B. Find the number of such strings that do not have more than $3$ adjacent letters that are identical..
SOLUTION AND REASONING: Step 1: Interpret the condition
We count 10-letter strings over {A, B} with no run of identical letters longer than 3. Equivalently, every run of consecutive identical letters has length 1, 2, or 3.

Step 2: Set up states
Let C_n(r) be the number of length-n strings that end with a run of length r of a fixed letter, say A. Here r ∈ {1, 2, 3}. By symmetry, the same counts apply for runs of B, so the total number of valid strings of length n is T_n = 2 * (C_n(1) + C_n(2) + C_n(3)).

Step 3: Recurrence relations
- C_n(1) = C_{n-1}(1) + C_{n-1}(2) + C_{n-1}(3)  (switch letter)
- C_n(2) = C_{n-1}(1)                         (same letter, run length increases from 1)
- C_n(3) = C_{n-1}(2)                         (same letter, run length increases from 2)

SOLUTION: 162

Step-by-step solution:
- Let the three 3-digit numbers be a1a2a3, a4a5a6, a7a8a9. Let H = a1 + a4 + a7 (hundreds), T = a2 + a5 + a8 (tens), U = a3 + a6 + a9 (units). Then
  s(p) = 100H + 10T + U and H + T + U = 1+2+…+9 = 45.

- Since the units digit of s(p) is 0, U ≡ 0 (mod 10). U is the sum of three distinct digits from 1..9, so 6 ≤ U ≤ 24. The only feasible values are U = 10 or U = 20.

- For fixed H, T, U with H + T + U = 45, write T = 45 − H − U. Then
  s(p) = 100H + 10(45 − H − U) + U = 90H + 450 − 9U.
  For fixed H, s decreases as U increases (coefficient −9).

- To minimize s, take the smallest possible H and the largest feasible U. The smallest H occurs when the hundreds digits are {1,2,3}, giving H = 6. The largest feasible U with the remaining digits is U = 20 (from triples among {4,5,6,7,8,9} that sum to 20).

- Check feasibility: with H = {1,2,3} and U = 20, the remaining digits for T are {4,5,6,7,8,9} minus the chosen U-triple. The triples summing to 20 from {4,5,6,7,8,9} are {4,7,9}, {5,6,9}, {5,7,8}. Thus U = 20 is feasible, and s(p) = 810 in these cases.

- Therefore m = 810.

- Count the number of permutations p attaining s(p) = 810:
  - H must be {1,2,3} in some order: 3! = 6 ways.
  - U must be one of the three triples summing to 20: 3 choices.
  - For a chosen U-triple, arrange its digits in the units positions a3, a6, a9: 3! = 6 ways.
  - The remaining three digits form T and can be arranged in the tens positions a2, a5, a8: 3! = 6 ways.

  Total n = 3 × 3! × 3! × 3! = 3 × 6 × 6 × 6 = 648.

Correct; the minimum is achieved with H = {1,2,3} and U = 20, giving m = 810, and there are exactly 3 choices for the U-triple and 3! permutations for H, U, and T digits, yielding n = 3 × 3! × 3! × 3! = 648, so |m − n| = 162.

Step 1: Basic data
- Let a = BC = 120, b = CA = 117, c = AB = 125.
- Semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 181.
- Inradius r satisfies r^2 = (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)/s = (61)(64)(56)/181 = 218624/181.

Step 2: Angles and half-angle sines
- Let α = ∠A, β = ∠B, γ = ∠C.
- Use sin(α/2), sin(β/2), sin(γ/2) via sines of halves:
  sin^2(α/2) = (s − b)(s − c)/(bc) = 64·56/(117·125) = 3584/14625,
  sin^2(β/2) = (s − c)(s − a)/(ca) = 56·61/(125·120) = 3416/15000,
  sin^2(γ/2) = (s − a)(s − b)/(ab) = 61·64/(120·117) = 3904/14040 = 488/1755.
- Also sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2) = (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)/(abc) = 218624/1555000.

Step 3: Distance MN via incenter geometry
- Let I be the incenter. The lines AL and BK are AI and BI, and N, M are the feet from C to these lines.
- Let sα = sin(α/2), sβ = sin(β/2), sγ = sin(γ/2).
- One can show (e.g., by projecting IC onto AI and BI and using the angle between AI and BI) that
  MN^2 = IC^2 [ sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ ].
- Since IC = r / sin(γ/2) = r / sγ, we obtain
  MN^2 = r^2 [ sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ ] / sγ^2.

Step 4: Compute the needed combination
- Let A = sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ.
  Using the expressions above (with common denominator 1,755,000), one gets
  A = 1267/1755.
- Also sγ^2 = 488/1755.
- Therefore A / sγ^2 = (1267/1755) / (488/1755) = 1267/488.

Step 5: Put it all together
- MN^2 = r^2 · (A / sγ^2) = (218624/181) · (1267/488).
- Note 218624/488 = 448, so MN^2 = 448 · 1267 / 181 = 567616 / 181.
- And 181 · 3136 = 567616, so MN^2 = 3136.

Thus MN = sqrt(3136) = 56.

- Let a = BC = 120, b = CA = 117, c = AB = 125.
- Semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = 181.
- Inradius r satisfies r^2 = (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)/s = (61)(64)(56)/181 = 218624/181.

Step 2: Angles and half-angle sines
- Let α = ∠A, β = ∠B, γ = ∠C.
- Use sin(α/2), sin(β/2), sin(γ/2) via sines of halves:
  sin^2(α/2) = (s − b)(s − c)/(bc) = 64·56/(117·125) = 3584/14625,
  sin^2(β/2) = (s − c)(s − a)/(ca) = 56·61/(125·120) = 3416/15000,
  sin^2(γ/2) = (s − a)(s − b)/(ab) = 61·64/(120·117) = 3904/14040 = 488/1755.
- Also sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2) = (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)/(abc) = 218624/1555000.

Step 3: Distance MN via incenter geometry
- Let I be the incenter. The lines AL and BK are AI and BI, and N, M are the feet from C to these lines.
- Let sα = sin(α/2), sβ = sin(β/2), sγ = sin(γ/2).
- One can show (e.g., by projecting IC onto AI and BI and using the angle between AI and BI) that
  MN^2 = IC^2 [ sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ ].
- Since IC = r / sin(γ/2) = r / sγ, we obtain
  MN^2 = r^2 [ sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ ] / sγ^2.

Step 4: Compute the needed combination
- Let A = sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ.
  Using the expressions above (with common denominator 1,755,000), one gets
  A = 1267/1755.
- Also sγ^2 = 488/1755.
- Therefore A / sγ^2 = (1267/1755) / (488/1755) = 1267/488.

Step 5: Put it all together
- MN^2 = r^2 · (A / sγ^2) = (218624/181) · (1267/488).
- Note 218624/488 = 448, so MN^2 = 448 · 1267 / 181 = 567616 / 181.
- And 181 · 3136 = 567616, so MN^2 = 3136.

Thus MN = sqrt(3136) = 56.",Step 3 makes a nontrivial and unproved leap by asserting MN^2 = IC^2 [sα^2 + sβ^2 + 2 sα sβ sγ] without any justification; this crucial identity needs a derivation (or citation) because an incorrect justification here would undermine the whole solution.,2026-02-22 20:16:39

[THOUGHT]
Step 1: Work modulo 11
- If two numbers a and b satisfy a ≡ r (mod 11) and b ≡ s (mod 11), then a − b ≡ r − s (mod 11).
- A difference of 4 or 7 is congruent to 4 or 7 modulo 11. Therefore, if we choose S to consist only of numbers whose residues modulo 11 lie in an independent set R of the graph on residues where r is connected to r ± 4 (mod 11), then no two numbers in S can differ by 4 or by 7, for any pair of blocks.

Step 2: Choose an independent set of residues
- Look for R ⊆ {0,1,...,10} with |R| = 5 and no two elements differing by ±4 (mod 11).
- One such independent set is R = {1, 3, 4, 6, 9} (mod 11). You can check that no pair in R differs by 4 or 7 modulo 11.

Step 3: Construct S and count its size
- Let S be all numbers in {1,2,...,1989} whose residue modulo 11 lies in R = {1,3,4,6,9}.
- Since 1989 = 11·180 + 9, residues 1–9 each occur 181 times, while residues 0 and 10 occur 180 times.
- All residues in R are in {1,...,9}, so |S| = 5 · 181 = 905.

Step 4: Upper bound to ensure maximality
- In any block of 11 consecutive integers, at most 5 can be chosen (the analogous independence bound for the 11-term block with forbidden gaps 4 and 7).
- There are 180 full blocks of 11 in 1..1980, contributing at most 180·5 = 900.
- The last block 1981–1989 has length 9, in which at most 5 can be chosen.
- Hence |S| ≤ 900 + 5 = 905.

Conclusion: The maximum possible size is 905, and it is achieved by the residue choice R = {1,3,4,6,9} modulo 11.

SOLUTION: 905

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is sound: using an independent set of residues modulo 11 of size 5 yields a valid S with 905 elements, and in every block of 11 consecutive integers at most 5 can be chosen, so 905 is maximal.
