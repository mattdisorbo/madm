Let the mean of set $\mathcal{S}$ be $ m $, and let the number of elements in $\mathcal{S}$ be $ n $.

### Step 1: Use the first condition
The mean of $\mathcal{S} \cup \{1\}$ is $13$ less than the mean of $\mathcal{S}$:

$$
\frac{nm + 1}{n + 1} = m - 13
$$

Multiply both sides by $ n + 1 $:

You are helping Person 1 solve the following math problem: The sides of rectangle $ABCD$ have lengths $10$ and $11$ . An equilateral triangle is drawn so that no point of the triangle lies outside $ABCD$ . The maximum possible area of such a triangle can be written in the form $p\sqrt{q}-r$ , where $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ are positive integers, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $p+q+r$ ..
