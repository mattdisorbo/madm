The statement is refuted because passive seismic surveys are not fundamentally different from conventional surveys in terms of methodology; both involve measurements, but passive seismic surveys use natural seismic waves and are typically less invasive and more cost-effective.

0","The statement claims that the Chinese moth *Ditrigona cirruncata* has one dark brown distal cell spot on each wing. This is likely incorrect, as the *Ditrigona cirruncata* is a species of moth, and the presence of a ""distal cell spot"" is not a standard or widely recognized feature of this species. Furthermore, the description of the color and location of the spot does not align with known morphological descriptions of this species.

PREDICTION: 0","The reasoning is flawed because it assumes the absence of a known feature (distal cell spot) in *Ditrigona cirruncata* implies the statement is false, without considering the possibility of this feature being undocumented or misinterpreted.",2026-02-24 17:57:13
