The statement claims that Kenneth Mburu Mungara finished first in twelve competitions in a decade from 2008, but there is no credible evidence to support this specific claim about his achievements during that time.

You are helping Person 1 with fact-checking. This statement needs to be checked: The 1910–11 Ottawa Hockey Club season finished with five wins more than the second place finisher..

[THOUGHT]
The statement claims a specific numerical difference in wins between the Ottawa Hockey Club and the second-place finisher in the 1910–11 season, but without access to the actual historical records of that season's standings, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of the claim.
