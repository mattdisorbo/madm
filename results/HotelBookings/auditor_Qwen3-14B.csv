SCENARIO:
You are helping predict Person 1's hotel booking decision. Person 1 has booked a hotel stay arriving on November 5, 2016 (week 45), with 0 weekend night(s) and 1 weekday night(s). The party consists of 1 adult(s). Person 1 is not a repeated guest and has 0 previous cancellation(s). They have requested 0 car parking space(s) and made 0 special request(s).

PREDICTION & REASONING:
Person 1 is likely to not cancel the booking because they have a single-night stay during a weekday, no weekend nights, no previous cancellations, and no special requests or parking needs, which reduces the likelihood of last-minute changes.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning overlooks potential factors such as the specific destination, seasonality, or external events that could influence cancellation likelihood, even for a short weekday stay with no special requests.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
