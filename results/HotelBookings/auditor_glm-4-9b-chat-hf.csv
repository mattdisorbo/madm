SCENARIO:
You are helping predict Person 1's hotel booking decision. Person 1 has booked a hotel stay arriving on April 2, 2016 (week 14), with 2 weekend night(s) and 2 weekday night(s). The party consists of 2 adult(s). Person 1 is not a repeated guest and has 0 previous cancellation(s). They have requested 0 car parking space(s) and made 1 special request(s).

PREDICTION & REASONING:
PREDICTION: 0

Reasoning: The fact that Person 1 is not a repeated guest and has no previous cancellation indicates a positive track record. Additionally, the request for car parking spaces and a special request suggest a careful consideration of their needs. Therefore, it is likely that Person 1 will not cancel their hotel booking.

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is overly simplistic and assumes a direct correlation between the given information and the likelihood of cancellation.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
