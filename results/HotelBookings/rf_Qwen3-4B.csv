You are helping predict Person 1's hotel booking decision. Person 1 has booked a hotel stay arriving on August 7, 2015 (week 32), with 2 weekend night(s) and 4 weekday night(s). The party consists of 2 adult(s). Person 1 is not a repeated guest and has 0 previous cancellation(s). They have requested 0 car parking space(s) and made 2 special request(s).A random forest trained on a similar dataset predicts Person 1 would not cancel this booking, based on a predicted probability of 0.050 that Person 1 would cancel. 

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (cancel) or 0 (not cancel) based on your prediction of Person 1's true decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of Person 1's true decision, or 1 to delegate to Person 1 so they can implement their true decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
