[THOUGHT]
I would change ""tends"" to ""tend"" to agree with the plural subject ""people,"" replace the incorrect plural ""medias"" with ""media,"" fix the spelling ""litterature"" to ""literature,"" and remove extra spaces before punctuation.

[CRITIQUE]
Your reasoning is sound — changing ""tends"" to ""tend,"" correcting ""medias"" to ""media,"" fixing ""litterature"" to ""literature,"" and removing extra spaces are all appropriate, though note ""media"" is already the plural of ""medium"" and can also function as a collective/mass noun.
