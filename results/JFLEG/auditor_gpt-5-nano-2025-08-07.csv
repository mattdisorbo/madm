CORRECTION: Since I liked the interior enough, I bought the car a few days later.

[THOUGHT]
But they do things in a different manner from others, which gives them success.
Because 'maner' should be 'manner' and 'than' should be 'from' in standard comparison, and a comma before 'which' is appropriate for a nonrestrictive clause.
CORRECTION: your grammatical correction here

[CRITIQUE]
Overall, the reasoning is mostly correct—fixing 'maner' to 'manner' and using 'from' with 'different' and adding a comma before 'which' are right—but it overstates that 'than' must always be replaced by 'from' since 'different than' is used in some varieties, and it could be improved by offering a smoother final version such as ""However, they do things in a different manner from others, which leads to their success.""
