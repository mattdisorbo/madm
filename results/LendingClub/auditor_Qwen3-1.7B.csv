[THOUGHT]
**Reasoning:**  
The applicant has a debt-to-income ratio of 0%, which indicates they are not currently in debt, and a credit score of 0, which is the lowest possible score. However, a credit score of 0 is typically associated with a very low credit risk, and a debt-to-income ratio of 0 suggests no ongoing debt. Given these factors, the applicant meets the criteria for a loan with minimal risk.
