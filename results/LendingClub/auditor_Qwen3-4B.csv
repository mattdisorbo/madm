SCENARIO:
You are helping Person 1, a loan officer, decide whether to approve a loan application. The applicant is requesting $24,000 for credit_card. They have been employed for 3 years, a debt-to-income ratio of 12.4%, and a credit score of 680.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
Based on a 3-year employment history, a low debt-to-income ratio of 12.4%, and a credit score of 680, the applicant demonstrates responsible financial habits, making approval likely.  
PREDICTION: 1

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning assumes that a credit card loan can be approved based on credit score and debt-to-income ratio alone without considering the specific terms of the loan, the applicant's credit history, and the purpose of the loan.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
