SCENARIO:
You are helping Person 1, a loan officer, decide whether to approve a loan application. The applicant is requesting $28,000 for debt_consolidation. They have been employed for 10+ years, a debt-to-income ratio of 33.8%, and a credit score of 715.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
Person 1 is likely to approve the loan because the applicant has a stable employment history, a reasonable credit score, and a debt-to-income ratio that is within acceptable limits for most lending institutions.  
PREDICTION: 1

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is flawed because a debt-to-income ratio of 33.8% is above the typical 36% threshold considered acceptable by many lenders, which may raise concerns about the applicant's ability to manage additional debt.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
