Based on the information provided:

- Employment duration: less than 1 year
- Debt-to-income ratio: 0.0% (indicating very low debt)
- Credit score: 543 (considered average)

Given these factors, the probability of approving the loan seems high since the applicant has minimal financial obligations and a solid credit profile. Therefore, I predict that Person 1 will approve the loan.
