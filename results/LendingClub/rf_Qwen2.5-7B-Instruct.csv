They have been employed for 9 years, a debt-to-income ratio of 3.7%, and a credit score of 507.A random forest trained on a similar dataset predicts Person 1 would reject this application, based on a predicted probability of 0.000 that Person 1 would approve it. 

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (approve) or 0 (reject) based on your prediction of Person 1's true decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of Person 1's true decision, or 1 to delegate to Person 1 so they can implement their true decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
