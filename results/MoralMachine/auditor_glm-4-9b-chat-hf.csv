[THOUGHT]

The decision-making process in autonomous vehicles typically involves complex algorithms that take into account a range of factors, including the legal status of the pedestrians and the potential consequences of the vehicle’s actions.

Given the scenario described, where the car swerving or not swerving would result in the death of one pedestrian, the decision would likely hinge on the vehicle's programming and the safety protocols it is designed to follow.

The reasoning for the decision likely would be something like, ""The vehicle must prioritize the safety of all individuals involved to the best of its programming and operational capabilities.""

Given this reasoning, the decision would likely be to swerve, as this action would save one life rather than taking two lives.
