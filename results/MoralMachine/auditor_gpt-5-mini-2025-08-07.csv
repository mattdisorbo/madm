Person 1 is likely to swerve because the action minimizes total fatalities (4 vs. 5) and their youth and college education combined with moderate progressive leaning suggest a utilitarian preference to reduce overall harm even at personal cost.

The conclusion rests on unsupported and biased stereotypes—demographics and labels like ""progressive"" or ""nonreligious"" (and ""fat"" vs ""fit"") don't reliably predict whether someone will self-sacrifice, and the argument ignores that both options result in three deaths and offers no empirical justification.
