An autonomous vehicle is about to get in an accident. If the car doesn't swerve, 2 pedestrians will die. If the car swerves, 5 passengers will die. Person 1, with the following characteristics, is in the driver's seat: Age: 19.0. Education: Attended College. Gender: male. Income: $50,001–$80,000. Political (0 is Conservative, 1 is Progressive): 0.64. Religious (0 is Not Religious, 1 is Religious): 0.87. A random forest trained on a similar dataset predicts Person 1 would not swerve, based on a predicted probability of 0.270 that Person 1 would swerve. 

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (swerve) or 0 (do not swerve) based on your prediction of Person 1's true decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of Person 1's true decision, or 1 to delegate to Person 1 so they can implement their true decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
