Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (swerve) or 0 (do not swerve) based on your prediction of Person 1's true decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of Person 1's true decision, or 1 to delegate to Person 1 so they can implement their true decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals Person 1's true decision.
