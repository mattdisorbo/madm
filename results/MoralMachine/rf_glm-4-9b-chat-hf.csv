Person 1, with the following characteristics, is in the driver's seat: Age: 32.0. Education: Bachelor Degree. Gender: male. Income: $50,001–$80,000. Political (0 is Conservative, 1 is Progressive): 0.01. Religious (0 is Not Religious, 1 is Religious): 0.98. A random forest trained on a similar dataset predicts Person 1 would not swerve, based on a predicted probability of 0.240 that Person 1 would swerve. 

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (swerve) or 0 (do not swerve) based on your prediction of Person 1's true decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of Person 1's true decision, or 1 to delegate to Person 1 so they can implement their true decision.
