- Piano, The (1993) (Drama|Romance)


PREDICTION & REASONING:
Person 1 has shown a preference for dramas and war/adventure films, with higher ratings for more serious and dramatic films like *The Conformist* and *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, suggesting they may prefer *The Piano* (Drama|Romance) over *The Nutty Professor* (Comedy|Fantasy|Romance|Sci-Fi), which is more lighthearted and comedic.

PREDICTION: 2

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is somewhat flawed because while Person 1 has shown a preference for dramas, they also rated *Terms of Endearment* (a comedy-drama) relatively low, suggesting their preference might not be solely for serious dramas, and their rating of *The Nutty Professor* could depend on other factors like humor or genre mix.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it matches the movie Person 1 would rate higher.
