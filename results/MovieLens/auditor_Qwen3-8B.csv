Person 1 has shown a preference for action and drama films with higher ratings, and ""Django Unchained"" (rated 4.5/5) aligns more with their taste than ""Struck by Lightning"" (a comedy-drama with no prior rating context), making it likely they would rate ""Django Unchained"" higher.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to Person 1.
A decision is correct if it matches the movie Person 1 would rate higher.

[DECISION]
0","Person 1 has shown a preference for dramas and adventures with high ratings, and ""The Great Gatsby"" fits the drama genre with a likely higher quality compared to the family-oriented comedy ""The Boss Baby.""  
PREDICTION: 1","The reasoning is flawed because it assumes ""The Great Gatsby"" will have a higher quality than ""The Boss Baby"" without considering that ""The Boss Baby"" could have a higher rating or appeal to Person 1's tastes despite being a family comedy.",2026-02-24 14:26:35
