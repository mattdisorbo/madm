Given that both movies are within the genres Person 1 has rated similarly, it is difficult to predict a preference without more information on Person 1’s taste within the Drama and Comedy genres.

[THOUGHT]

Explaination: Based on the ratings given by Person 1, two of the movies they've rated were from the genres found in ""The Blair Witch Project, The"" and ""Wedding Crashers.""

Considering ""The Blair Witch Project,"" Person 1 has given a higher rating to movies from the horror genre, as evidenced by their 3.0/5 rating for ""Dogma.""

Similarly, Person 1 has rated movies from the comedy genre quite highly, as seen with a 5.0/5 rating for ""Fight Club.""

Predicting movie preferences based solely on past ratings is a complex task. However, considering the genres and ratings of the movies Person 1 has reviewed, we can infer a preference pattern.

Person 1 has shown a preference for crime and thriller movies, as evident from the high ratings given to ""District 9,"" ""Psycho,"" and the somewhat lower but still positive rating given to ""American Beauty.""
