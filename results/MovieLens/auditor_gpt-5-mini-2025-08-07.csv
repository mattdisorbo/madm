[THOUGHT]
They tend to prefer lighter action/romantic comedies and big‑scale sci‑fi (Princess Bride 4.0, Pineapple Express 3.5, Star Wars 4.5) and have given low marks to darker thrillers/satires (Babel, Idiocracy), so The Proposal (a rom‑com) is likelier to score higher than the darker sci‑fi thriller Repo Men.

PREDICTION: 2

[CRITIQUE]
The logic overgeneralizes from a tiny, genre‑mixed sample and contradicts itself—if they favor lighter rom‑coms and big, upbeat sci‑fi, The Proposal should be predicted higher than the darker Repo Men, so assigning a ""2"" is unjustified.
