[THOUGHT]
They tend to reward big, high-energy action-adventure with sci-fi/fantasy scale and ensemble casts, which Civil War delivers more strongly than Winter Soldier's darker espionage focus. 
PREDICTION: 2

[CRITIQUE]
The argument relies on a single criterion (big sci‑fi action with an ensemble) and wrongly assumes Winter Soldier lacks that mix; Winter Soldier is a high‑energy, ensemble-driven film with substantial tech/spy science elements, so predicting Civil War over Winter Soldier oversimplifies the user's tastes.
