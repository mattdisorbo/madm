[THOUGHT]
The comment is a question about a ""featured"" star being lost in the article, which suggests a possible complaint or concern about the visibility or accuracy of the article. This type of comment often indicates dissatisfaction or a request for clarification, which can be considered toxic in a crowd-work context if it's aimed at the staff or team.

**Reasoning:** The comment expresses a concern about the article's content or presentation, which is a common form of toxicity in crowdsourced tasks. It is not a direct accusation but rather a critique, which can still be seen as toxic if it is used to discourage or undermine the team.

The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as potentially toxic, but it oversimplifies the situation by assuming all critiques of article presentation are inherently toxic, without considering the context of crowd-work and the possibility of constructive feedback.

 :``Sich riflemen`` (1917-1919)refers to events when some of the the unit went to Kyiv and started a different group by absorbing local fighters and the youth organisation 
  
 As you can see these are military units, or at least para military, and so are not really related to the scouting movement, more related to the military term scout - someone who knows a lot about the local area and is used for forwards observation. These scout units established in Europe during the first part of the 20th century were not really akin to the modern day scout units. They were paramilitary units designed for living off the land and defending the homeland during times of war or invasion. 
 It may be that you are wishing to start a ``Ukranian Scouts page`` to support the modern day scouting movement since the fall of the USSR, there is not one so if that was your wish I am sure that would be OK

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a complex and potentially sensitive discussion about national identity, cultural heritage, and political ideology. It raises questions about self-identification, cultural belonging, and the role of education in shaping one's nationality. The speaker claims to be a Polish citizen by birth but also identifies as a German by education and background. The tone is confrontational and critical, suggesting that others do not recognize the speaker's identity or the complexity of their background. This level of ideological and cultural debate could be seen as potentially toxic in a collaborative environment.

**Reasoning:** The comment is a warning against spamming Wikipedia with links, which is a form of vandalism. It is not a direct accusation of toxicity but rather a guideline for behavior.

The comment expresses frustration and criticism toward the idea that a major corporation cares about the well-being of its employees in the context of a Wikipedia edit war.

The comment contains a logical argument that suggests the user is trying to prevent the use of WP:SYNTHESIS by requiring a reliable source to contradict a statement. The tone is critical and argumentative, implying that the user is challenging the validity of a statement without providing evidence. The comment also mentions a hypothetical scenario where a reliable historian would need to produce an equally reliable source to counter a claim, which is a common tactic in debates about factual accuracy.

Given the argumentative tone and the requirement for a reliable source, the comment is likely intended to discourage the use of WP:SYNTHESIS without proper evidence.
