[THOUGHT]
The comment is a question about a ""featured"" star being lost in the article, which suggests a possible complaint or concern about the visibility or accuracy of the article. This type of comment often indicates dissatisfaction or a request for clarification, which can be considered toxic in a crowd-work context if it's aimed at the staff or team.

**Reasoning:** The comment expresses a concern about the article's content or presentation, which is a common form of toxicity in crowdsourced tasks. It is not a direct accusation but rather a critique, which can still be seen as toxic if it is used to discourage or undermine the team.

The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as potentially toxic, but it oversimplifies the situation by assuming all critiques of article presentation are inherently toxic, without considering the context of crowd-work and the possibility of constructive feedback.

 :``Sich riflemen`` (1917-1919)refers to events when some of the the unit went to Kyiv and started a different group by absorbing local fighters and the youth organisation 
  
 As you can see these are military units, or at least para military, and so are not really related to the scouting movement, more related to the military term scout - someone who knows a lot about the local area and is used for forwards observation. These scout units established in Europe during the first part of the 20th century were not really akin to the modern day scout units. They were paramilitary units designed for living off the land and defending the homeland during times of war or invasion. 
 It may be that you are wishing to start a ``Ukranian Scouts page`` to support the modern day scouting movement since the fall of the USSR, there is not one so if that was your wish I am sure that would be OK

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a complex and potentially sensitive discussion about national identity, cultural heritage, and political ideology. It raises questions about self-identification, cultural belonging, and the role of education in shaping one's nationality. The speaker claims to be a Polish citizen by birth but also identifies as a German by education and background. The tone is confrontational and critical, suggesting that others do not recognize the speaker's identity or the complexity of their background. This level of ideological and cultural debate could be seen as potentially toxic in a collaborative environment.

**Reasoning:** The comment is a warning against spamming Wikipedia with links, which is a form of vandalism. It is not a direct accusation of toxicity but rather a guideline for behavior.

 Look please stop! And who is Kum Wat...hope it is not me!'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
**Reasoning:** The comment is a warning to stop labeling the comment as toxic, and it expresses concern that the person being labeled might be the speaker themselves. This suggests a potential for hostility or frustration, but it does not clearly indicate toxicity in the traditional sense (e.g., hate speech, harassment, or explicit threats). The tone is more of a demand for respect and clarification rather than a direct attack.

**PREDICTION: 0** (not toxic)

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as a warning and expresses concern, but it fails to account for the potential for implicit harm or escalation, which could make the comment toxic in a more nuanced or context-sensitive sense.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

0","The comment contains a mix of supportive and critical statements about Wikipedia's reliability and the potential for IP bans, but the overall tone is more defensive and cautious, with a focus on the practical implications of banning IP addresses. The speaker acknowledges the existence of IP vandals but also expresses a willingness to take action, which suggests a moderate stance. However, the comment does not clearly indicate a strong endorsement of toxicity or a clear call for banning users.

The only reference of his title was given above to further show consistency with that of the ``Chief of`` title (7x19). If an article page is generated for the character, the title of ``Head`` would be inappropriate as it has never been stated by the show. •   
  
  
 `'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment argues that the character Robert Stark's title should be ""Head"" instead of ""Chief of Pediatric Surgery"" because it was never officially stated in the show, and the title ""Head"" is inappropriate for someone whose title was ambiguous and never confirmed. The comment also references specific episodes and actors to support its claim. This suggests that the comment is trying to correct a perceived inconsistency in the character's title, which could be seen as a critique of the article's content.

PREDICTION: 1 (toxic)  
The comment is critical of the article's handling of character titles, suggesting that the title

The reasoning is valid but overly focused on the title inconsistency, which may be a minor issue rather than a definitive indicator of toxicity.

The comment is highly critical of the UN Security Council's role in enforcing human rights, questioning its authority and the practicality of legal enforcement. It also challenges the crowd-worker's assumptions about the UN's ability to enforce rights, suggesting that the UNSC may not actually enforce what it wants to.

 So I guess your explanation of WP:CSD#T1 is still Zero. Once again you have failed to explain why a page weas deleted under WP:CSD#T1 and then threatened the inquirer with a block. Poor form. Extremely poor form.  '.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment is clearly expressing strong dissatisfaction with the crowd-worker's failure to address the issue of the page being deleted under WP:CSD#T1 and threatening the inquirer with a block. The tone is aggressive and confrontational, indicating a lack of understanding or proper handling of the situation. 

PREDICTION: 1 (toxic)

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies the aggressive tone and the lack of understanding, but it fails to account for the possibility that the comment could be a legitimate critique of the crowd-worker's handling of the issue, even if the language is confrontational.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

**Reasoning:** The comment contains a sarcastic and critical remark about the Australia national football team (Socceroos) being widely known to all Australians, regardless of their interest in soccer. This implies a dismissive or mocking tone, which is a common indicator of toxicity in online discourse. The comment also uses a humorous but potentially offensive analogy, which can be seen as disrespectful or unwelcome.

[THOUGHT]
The comment is a strong critique of the removal of a section from a Wikipedia article, arguing that the removal is unjustified, the article is too short, and the crowd-workers are being unreasonable. The tone is confrontational, and the comment clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the action taken. The comment also includes a demand for a logical explanation and a compromise.

**Reasoning:** The comment is clearly expressing dissatisfaction with the removal of a section, arguing that the removal is unjustified, and that the article is too short. The tone and content suggest a strong objection to the action taken, which is a key indicator of toxicity.

The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as toxic due to its confrontational tone, strong objections, and demand for a logical explanation, which are key indicators of toxicity on Wikipedia.

You are helping a group of crowd-workers label Wikipedia discussion comments as toxic or not. This comment needs to be checked: ' 
  
 ==Aww...== 
 That wasn't very nice, sweetcheeks.'.

[THOUGHT]
**Reasoning:** The comment uses a playful and affectionate tone (""Aww..."") followed by a critical remark (""That wasn't very nice, sweetcheeks""), which suggests a mix of sarcasm and mild criticism. While the tone is not aggressive, the comment is still perceived as unkind and potentially negative in context. The use of ""sweetcheeks"" implies a dismissive or mocking tone, which can be considered toxic in a Wikipedia discussion setting.

**PREDICTION: 1** (toxic)

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning correctly identifies the mixed tone and potential negative implications, but it could be improved by more explicitly addressing the specific characteristics of toxic behavior in Wikipedia discussions, such as the use of informal language and the intent to harm or discredit.

 1. French people often refer to Metropolitan France as L'Hexagone (The ``Hexagon``) because of the geometric shape of its territory. 
  
 Unless it was a Frenchman or Frenchwoman who added that in, how can we know for certain that they really do? Is this self-made nickname for that region so internationally renowned that it's a surefire fact? Unless one can respond in the affirmative to either question, It needs a citation. 
  
 2. There are various theories as to the origin of the name of the Franks. One is that it is derived from the Proto-Germanic word frankon which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the Franks was known as a francisca. 
  
 Another proposed etymology is that in an ancient Germanic language, Frank means free as opposed to slave. This word still exists in French as franc, it is also used as the translation of ``Frank`` and to name the local money, until the use of the Euro in the 2000s. 
  
 However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank, it is also probable that the word is derived from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means ``Realm of the Franks``. In order to distinguish from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, Modern France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Realm is called Frankenreich.

Predicting the crowd-workers' aggregate decision: The comment is a redirect template for a Wikipedia page, which is a standard markup used to link pages. Redirects are generally considered neutral and not toxic. The content does not contain any harmful or abusive language, and it is a technical artifact of the Wikipedia system.

PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies that the comment is a redirect template and thus neutral, but it overlooks the potential for some crowd-workers to misinterpret it as harmful or malicious, especially if they lack technical knowledge of Wikipedia's markup.

The comment presents a nuanced critique of a user's editing behavior, acknowledging potential violations of NPOV and self-promotion while highlighting the user's willingness to discuss, seek consensus, and avoid harmful editing practices. The tone is constructive, critical of typical self-promoters, and suggests that the user is above the norm in terms of editorial integrity and approach. The reasoning is that the user is not malicious, is engaging in respectful editing, and is not engaging in harmful or disruptive behavior.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a reference to a specific person (Dr. Rauni Kilde) and a term (""physical reality"") that is not typically associated with toxicity in the context of Wikipedia discussions. However, the use of double quotes around ""physical reality"" may indicate a specific reference or term that could be considered sensitive or controversial in certain contexts.

You are helping a group of crowd-workers label Wikipedia discussion comments as toxic or not. This comment needs to be checked: '`Dr. Rauni Kilde about the ``physical reality`` 
 `'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains a reference to a specific person (Dr. Rauni Kilde) and a term (""physical reality"") that is not typically associated with toxicity in the context of Wikipedia discussions. However, the use of double quotes around ""physical reality"" may indicate a specific reference or term that could be considered sensitive or controversial in certain contexts. Given the lack of clear evidence of hate speech, harassment, or harmful intent, the aggregate decision is likely to be ""not toxic.""

PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning assumes that the absence of clear evidence of harmful intent or contextual sensitivity justifies classifying the comment as ""not toxic,"" but it overlooks the potential for the term ""physical reality"" to carry implicit or explicit connotations that could be perceived as sensitive or controversial in certain communities.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

You are helping a group of crowd-workers label Wikipedia discussion comments as toxic or not. This comment needs to be checked: ' by calling people for their behavior,'.

[THOUGHT]
The comment ""by calling people for their behavior"" is likely to be considered toxic because it implies criticism of individuals based on their behavior, which can be seen as disrespectful or offensive. This type of language is commonly associated with toxic behavior in online discussions.

PREDICTION: 1 (toxic)

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is somewhat flawed because the phrase ""by calling people for their behavior"" is not inherently toxic; it can be a neutral or even constructive critique of behavior, depending on context and intent.

The comment is highly critical of the minority viewpoint held by the crowd-workers, arguing that this viewpoint should not be represented as significant or mainstream, and it calls for editing the section to meet Wikipedia standards. It also expresses frustration with the crowd-workers' stance and emphasizes the importance of maintaining Wikipedia's neutrality and accuracy. The tone is defensive and confrontational, with a clear intent to challenge the validity of the minority viewpoint.

The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as toxic by highlighting its attempt to suppress minority viewpoints and challenge Wikipedia's neutrality, but it could be strengthened by explicitly referencing specific Wikipedia policies, such as the ""Neutral Point of View"" guideline, to reinforce the connection to the platform's standards.

[THOUGHT]
Predict the crowd-workers' aggregate decision: The comment contains a sarcastic and dismissive tone, questioning the legitimacy of multiple accounts and implying that the speaker is being mocked. This suggests a potential negative sentiment towards the comment.

PREDICTION: 1 (toxic)

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is slightly off: while the comment contains sarcastic and dismissive language, it is more neutral and does not clearly indicate toxicity, so a prediction of 1 (toxic) may be overly harsh.

 Tunisia is officially a belligerant. Gadaffi forces invaded this morning   11:37, 29'.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a date and time, followed by a statement about Tunisia and Gadaffi, which is likely a political or historical claim. The mention of ""belligerant"" and the reference to an invasion suggest potential sensitivity or controversy. However, without clear evidence of toxicity (such as侮辱, hate speech, or explicit threats), the comment is neutral in content. The presence of a timestamp and the context of a Wikipedia discussion may influence the crowd-worker's decision, but the content itself does not clearly indicate toxicity.

PREDICTION: 0 (not toxic)

The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as neutral in content and lacks clear indicators of toxicity, but it may overlook the potential for implicit bias or contextual sensitivity in a Wikipedia discussion.
