 ::I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final ``court of appeal`` but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single ``accountability moment`` once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11`'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-14B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 == Are you an admin, Lomn? If so, a little help? == 
  
 An admin by the name of  seems to have had a really bad time lately and when I try to reason with him and make him feel better towards me, nothing good came out of it. Evidently, other parts of his life landed him ``on the warpath``, therefore, he has gotten enraged at me for comparatively small things. 
  
 I got worried when I messaged him in IRC the other day but he never replied. He reverted an edit of mine (even though it fit the subject), so I decided to leave a message on his user talk page. As I'll post below, I was trying to make him feel better, at least towards me (although I guess I tried to make him feel better overall.) See? It just blows up in my face. Then he tells me to leave him alone. Not only did that throw me into a depression, if he wants me to leave him alone, then he should do the same to me by not watching and going after my edits. As of right now, if he goes after my edits in any way, he just reminds me of how he so bluntly and uncompassionately shunned me, ignored me, and did exactly the opposite of what I wanted from him. 
  
 I was about to post it onto WP:RFC but a guideline states that at least two people had to fail to resolve a dispute first. 
  
 So to kind of reiterate: What I want is for Freakofnurture to treat me in any way that doesn't invoke negative feelings in me, or if he still wants to leave me alone, for Freakofnurture to let another admin watch my edits and go after them if necessary. In any case, I don't want to feel hated nor shunned by this guy for any reason, even whenever I simply see his name.   
  
 Here is the conversation between him and I. In what sentences did I mistakenly make him feel worse?:
