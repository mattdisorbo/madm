 ::I did find it surprising that nowhere is due process mentioned in Arbcom's procedures. There is a fourth problem that hasn't previously been mentioned which is the lack of any practicable route of appeal for Arbcom's decisions. Yes, in theory Jimbo is the final ``court of appeal`` but that is not a route which anyone takes seriously, as far as I can tell. In practical terms the only recourse is to appeal to Arbcom itself, but how likely is it that Arbcom will admit that it's got something wrong? If Arbcom's conduct during a case has thrown due process out of the window, what is the likelihood that it will find itself at fault? Human pride and institutional defensiveness, if nothing else, will count against it. Right now, if Arbcom commits an abuse of process there is no way of correcting it other than voting out the offending arbitrators, which could take years depending in which tranche of elections they're due to come up for a vote. There is no process for anyone other than Arbcom to review cases, nor for egregious mishandling of a case to be tackled. In effect we have a single ``accountability moment`` once a year and there is no accountability, no recourse and no effective oversight of how they have conducted themselves. What is needed, I think, is a much stricter set of rules governing what Arbcom does, combined with an independent appeals procedure that is empowered to review Arbcom's own conduct and set aside remedies if they have been passed without due process being followed.   16:11`'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-14B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

 == Are you an admin, Lomn? If so, a little help? == 
  
 An admin by the name of  seems to have had a really bad time lately and when I try to reason with him and make him feel better towards me, nothing good came out of it. Evidently, other parts of his life landed him ``on the warpath``, therefore, he has gotten enraged at me for comparatively small things. 
  
 I got worried when I messaged him in IRC the other day but he never replied. He reverted an edit of mine (even though it fit the subject), so I decided to leave a message on his user talk page. As I'll post below, I was trying to make him feel better, at least towards me (although I guess I tried to make him feel better overall.) See? It just blows up in my face. Then he tells me to leave him alone. Not only did that throw me into a depression, if he wants me to leave him alone, then he should do the same to me by not watching and going after my edits. As of right now, if he goes after my edits in any way, he just reminds me of how he so bluntly and uncompassionately shunned me, ignored me, and did exactly the opposite of what I wanted from him. 
  
 I was about to post it onto WP:RFC but a guideline states that at least two people had to fail to resolve a dispute first. 
  
 So to kind of reiterate: What I want is for Freakofnurture to treat me in any way that doesn't invoke negative feelings in me, or if he still wants to leave me alone, for Freakofnurture to let another admin watch my edits and go after them if necessary. In any case, I don't want to feel hated nor shunned by this guy for any reason, even whenever I simply see his name.   
  
 Here is the conversation between him and I. In what sentences did I mistakenly make him feel worse?:

 == Texas Tech seal images == 
  
 I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold: 
  
 First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , ``[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university``, whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a ``unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System``.  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that ``[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University`` and that ``[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature`` (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it. 
  
 The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a). 
  
 Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility. 
  
 Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  `'.",auditor,Qwen/Qwen3-14B,0,0.0,"[PROMPT]

Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that ``[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University`` and that ``[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature`` (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it. 
  
 The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a). 
  
 Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility. 
  
 Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  `'.
