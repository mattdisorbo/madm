 == Ceiling fan article edit == 
  
 Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions. 
  
 I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates. 
  
 Howeverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards. 
  
 This is how the statement read before you edited it: 
  
 ``Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.`` 
  
 You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads: 
  
 ``The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.```` 
  
 ...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful. 
  
 I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say ``Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!``. I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the ``bone-chilling`` factor into the mix. 
  
 Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page.

 Thanks a lot. Before I thought wiki stores only diff's between versions. As we can think that the most simple compression method is saving the diff sections For example, in order to save  
 {1000, 1003, 1005, 1021, 1240, 1241} we only needed to save {1000, 3+, 2+, 16+, 1240, 1+}, and 
 this is indentical to the basic of image compression like jpeg, or motion compression like mpeg. 
 In order to save motion pictures, mpeg used I frame, P frame, P frame, ..., I frame, P frame, ...., 
 so I was suprised to hear that wiki saves all the verion in full text format. Anyway thanks.  
 It would be great to have a page something like wikipedia:wikipage storage format that explains 
 in detail how the wikipedia saves its every pages of every version in detail and how the editing warrings (edit battle?) effects on the storage usage and how a single character addition effects on the storage usage, etc. If you had some authority on wiki and knew the stroge mechanism of wiki, how about to edit that page?

 ::::::P.S. A quote from Einstein (according to Wikiquote): As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. (I'd like to add that as far as anything refers to reality it is not certain.)'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains a philosophical quote about the nature of mathematics and reality, which is neither offensive nor harmful in tone or content.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that philosophical content cannot be toxic, but the comment may still be considered toxic if it is used to dismiss or belittle others' viewpoints in a harmful manner.
