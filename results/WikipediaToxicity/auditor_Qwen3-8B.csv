 == Ceiling fan article edit == 
  
 Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions. 
  
 I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates. 
  
 Howeverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards. 
  
 This is how the statement read before you edited it: 
  
 ``Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.`` 
  
 You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads: 
  
 ``The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.```` 
  
 ...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful. 
  
 I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say ``Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!``. I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the ``bone-chilling`` factor into the mix. 
  
 Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page.

 Thanks a lot. Before I thought wiki stores only diff's between versions. As we can think that the most simple compression method is saving the diff sections For example, in order to save  
 {1000, 1003, 1005, 1021, 1240, 1241} we only needed to save {1000, 3+, 2+, 16+, 1240, 1+}, and 
 this is indentical to the basic of image compression like jpeg, or motion compression like mpeg. 
 In order to save motion pictures, mpeg used I frame, P frame, P frame, ..., I frame, P frame, ...., 
 so I was suprised to hear that wiki saves all the verion in full text format. Anyway thanks.  
 It would be great to have a page something like wikipedia:wikipage storage format that explains 
 in detail how the wikipedia saves its every pages of every version in detail and how the editing warrings (edit battle?) effects on the storage usage and how a single character addition effects on the storage usage, etc. If you had some authority on wiki and knew the stroge mechanism of wiki, how about to edit that page?

 ::::::P.S. A quote from Einstein (according to Wikiquote): As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. (I'd like to add that as far as anything refers to reality it is not certain.)'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains a philosophical quote about the nature of mathematics and reality, which is neither offensive nor harmful in tone or content.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that philosophical content cannot be toxic, but the comment may still be considered toxic if it is used to dismiss or belittle others' viewpoints in a harmful manner.

I recommend you read the above materials about editing Wikipedia, enumerated in  the welcome message above. And ``talking to close friends`` is not evidence of properly sourced or even accurate text.`'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment criticizes another user for adding unsourced text and removing parts of their contribution, which is a constructive and rule-based feedback without personal attacks or harmful language.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as constructive and rule-based, but fails to recognize that the phrase ""talking to close friends"" could be perceived as dismissive or derogatory, potentially making the comment toxic.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

I asked her to bring the RfC to help bring closure to this, but now I am uncertain it will have any beneficial effect. Even if the RfC closes with a view against Kelly, it doesn't resolve the dispute. Kelly will still view me as a ``problem admin``, and will continue to consider me such with her ``trusted peers`` as she put it. So, whether this RfC concludes in my favor or not, I still lose. I fear the only possible conclusion to this that might at least stop the debate is an oath by both of us not to comment on the actions of the other.

Until the discussion reaches a consensus, it is best to avoid adding Saudi Arabia's claim of killing over 500 Houthi fighters, otherwise your edits would be regarded as disruptive.  
  
 Thanks.   `'.

 :*``It is rather wide for its height`` In who's opinion? It's proportions look OK to me. 
  
 :*``During the 16th century, the space for cathedral services must have been very cramped.[citation needed] This necessitated a rearrangement of the cathedral's furnishings.`` Did cathedrals have furnishings (beyond an altar and misericords etc)  and if they did what were they? I don't see why they woudl have made the cathedral cramped - pews etc weren't around at that time.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a series of questions and disagreements that challenge the accuracy of statements in a Wikipedia discussion, which can be seen as undermining the credibility of the original claims and potentially contributing to a hostile or dismissive tone.  

PREDICTION: 1

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as potentially toxic due to its confrontational and dismissive tone, but it oversimplifies by not considering that the questions may be constructive critiques rather than outright hostility.

For instance, if the Guardian ranks the number of complaints by students of the ``thinking makes my a head ache`` type, it can easily be explained that Maths depts that close down immediately become a whole lot better.   
  
 `'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains sarcastic and mocking language, implying that closing down math departments is a solution to a humorous problem, which can be seen as dismissive and derogatory towards the subject and its students.  
PREDICTION: 1

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning overlooks the potential sarcasm and irony in the comment, which may not necessarily indicate toxicity but rather a humorous or satirical critique.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

 I got your message and whatnots about that user snitching on me to you over some bs that he's crying about. I make a minor edit and all of a sudden this inferior, pops out and reverses my edit, thus I re-edited it again. A day or so he starts replying at me with his angry words and starts slamming me over it and re-edits the division list. That's when I responded back at him and did my revision again. The next thing you know me and him go to war on worlds, until he starts ratting me out and you're now warning me that I will be hindered from editing, for failure to abide with the guilelines of Wikipedia. I think you need to see what he wrote and catch him in the act, as well.'.

The comment contains aggressive language, personal attacks, and accusations of ""snitching"" and ""ratting out,"" which reflect a toxic and hostile tone towards another user.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains derogatory remarks about Wikipedia users, suggesting they are ""older people who are tired of living"" and implies that the platform is only useful for leaving legacies, which can be seen as disrespectful and toxic.  
PREDICTION: 1

The reasoning correctly identifies derogatory and disrespectful language, but it oversimplifies the comment by focusing on the tone rather than explicitly addressing the presence of hate speech, harassment, or targeted insults that are more clearly defined as toxic.

 The first inserted/reverted sentence reads: 
 :In Islam, the Arabic text Bath, Batha and Tabaath is found in the Qu'ran 62:2 Sura Al-Jumua The Qu'ran, Sura 62:2 http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm and is believed to be refering to Buddha.Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007

 :# http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/quran/06201.htm 
 :# Maulana Abdul Haque Vidyarti, Muhammad in World Scriptures Vol 3 pg.1007 
  
 So, it appears to me that the reason that this sentence is pertinent to the word ``Buddha`` is because it identifies a possible referent in the Qu'ran to the Buddha (or a buddha?).  Since this article is about definitions of the word ``Buddha`` per se — and not about the historical/mythic Buddha or other buddhas — it seems to me that this sentence is inappropriate for this article.  It should go in the appropriate article (e.g., possibly Gautama Buddha or Buddhahood).  Right?  Does this make sense?  This dab page is about the word ``Buddha`` and contains pointers to articles that then provide meanings to this word.  The above sentence alludes to the meaning of ``Buddha`` as Gautama Buddha (or, again, perhaps Buddhahood, still not clear to me from the sentence -) ).  Perhaps in terms of semantic cohesion, it would best fit in Gautama Buddha in world religions?  What do y'all think?     
  
 === Buddha (Arabic) === 
 The second inserted/reverted sentence reads: 
 :The origin of the word Buddha in Arabic is; of descent, or he roused him, and put into action. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad 
  
 The (hidden) reference is: 
 :4. Buddha Foretels The Advent of Muhammad 
  
 Here this sentence does in fact provide a new instance of the word ``Buddha,`` separate from the existing denotations (of Gautama Buddha, Buddhahood, Buddharupa, etc.).  I think the next question becomes whether or not every instantiation of this word is worthy of an entry on this WP dab page.  For example, I previously mentioned one prior suggestion, that an entry be identified as a noteworthy instance of the word in another reliable source, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, the Columbia Encyclopedia, dictionaries from Oxford University Press, etc.  Nat mentioned the matter of each entry on this dab page being associated with an individual WP article (e.g., Buddha Records, Buddha Air, etc.).  This sentence appears to fail to meet either of these suggested standards.  Perhaps if not worthy of an entry in the WP encyclopedia, might it be worth an entry in the Wiktionary (here)?

 This is the second time I've removed violations from this page. I suggest you stop using your user page to whine about me, and read WP:USER.  20:52, 3 August'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains a warning and a directive, but it does not include explicit hate speech, personal attacks, or harmful content, so it is more of a conflict resolution message than a toxic comment.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is flawed because while the comment may not contain explicit hate speech, it includes hostile language and a directive that could be seen as aggressive or dismissive, making it potentially toxic.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

 Wikipedia:WikiProject Succession Box Standardization:  The work of this group is interesting, even though I am not myself drawn to join in at this point.  I did ask the following question in the SBS WikiProject talk/forum ... (in anticipation of something we both might want to tackle in the future?): 
  
 Exceptions to standardization?  My guess is that there are some plausible and well-informed reasons for those cases in which standardization is not the best choice.   
  
 My question becomes relevant in that context:  Will someone please give me one example in which an understandable interest in standardization was not sufficient to overcome the reasons for a specific non-standard succession box?  One would hope that there would have been more than one illustrative example ...?   
  
 :I understand your question to be, 'Are there examples where the standard succession box is not the best choice.'  There is a long-standing disagreement about which article should be linked to from U.S. representative's boxes (discussion here: Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox) .  For example, should New Hampshire representatives' boxes link to United States Congressional Delegations from New Hampshire or List of United States Representatives from New Hampshire?  I happen to like the former, since all of these articles for all of the states are fully populated.  Another editor very much would like it to be the latter, expecting the articles to become populated once many articles link to them.  If the Template talk:USRepSuccessionBox gets changed, I was contemplating creating an alternate standard for some states, which admittedly wouldn't be ideal.  
  
 ::Standardization of succession boxes is something we try to do to fit all needs.  Quite often we find exceptions to the rule, but when that occurs, we either bring it up here to discuss, or find some easy and manageable solution that attempts to correct it.  Personally, I have run across numerous templates that are not in this series and cannot easily be corrected to work with it.  In those cases, I try to convert everything I can in the code and leave or customize the rest to work with the format established.  This was everything that has been standardized is standardized, leaving only the code that we currently have no standards for.  As you can tell from the templates page, there are many templates in this series and many that are not.  Some of the members including myself are attempting to remove as many of the older (and often very complex) templates to this simpler format.  However, some templates such as those for the Canadian parliament are not even undergoing review currently until the current problems are resolved due to their advanced codings. 
  
 ::I hope this somewhat answers your question.  Was there anything specific you were wondering about?– (  •  )  
  
 :::I must add that I have myself been removing such templates for quite some time, and have adopted a specific format for both Representatives and Senators, samples of which one can find in the succession boxes for the United States Presidents. My versions look essentially the same as the old ones, with some redundant text having been removed. Link modifications can be performed on these newer, simplified templates much easier, as editing a template is a very different thing indeed from simply editing pages. ,   
  
 Cut me some slack here, please: I'm the one who initially asked about exceptions to standardization, and now I'm going to try to sketch a bit of the rationale behind that query.  In a way, I hesitated to post any question in the first place for fear of arousing anyone's too eager interest  but now I have no choice but to deal with any unanticipated consequences.

But that doesn't mean an agreement can't be reached upon where your articles could still potentially reach GA. 
  
 :First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria. 
  
 :Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from. 
  
 :There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work. 
  
 :Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable. 
  
 :#A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya. 
 :#You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists. 
 :::The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool. 
  
 :Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.
