 == Ceiling fan article edit == 
  
 Thanks for your recent contrib to the ceiling fan article. It's good when people edit things, because it sparks thought in new directions. 
  
 I admire the originality of your thought, and the level of observance required to note such a detail as a fan's usefulness in humid versus dry climates. 
  
 Howeverand I mean this in an amusing way, rather than offensivelyyou were totally wrong. The statement about a fan's usefulness in dry versus humid climates was, in fact, not backwards. 
  
 This is how the statement read before you edited it: 
  
 ``Since a fan creates its cooling effect by speeding the evaporation of moisture on human skin, its perceived usefulness is directly correlated with the amount of humidity (moisture) in the room. In dry environments, such as desert climates, a fan has a lesser perceived usefulness than in humid environments; this is especially notable during cold weather, where a humid environment has a pronounced wind-chill effect which is lacking in dry environments.`` 
  
 You said, in your edit summary, to refer to the heat index article. So I did. The introductory paragraph to that article reads: 
  
 ``The human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, in which the water in the sweat evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, the evaporation rate of water is reduced. This means heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air.```` 
  
 ...thus proving that my original statement in my ceiling fan article was correct. In humid climates, heat is naturally removed from the body at a lower rate than in dry climates, causing a person to remain hotter longer than in dry climates. Thus, there is a greater need for a fan than in desert climatesthus it is perceived as being more useful. 
  
 I saw, via your userpage, that you've grown up in New York. I'm originally from the east coast myself, and I lived here my whole life save for two years in Utaha very distinct desert climate. The lack of humidity out there is actually quite a pleasure. In the summer there, it can be 105 degrees and feel no hotter than 85 here on the east coastyou look at the thermometer there and say ``Wow, I didn't realize it's over 100this isn't that uncomfortable!``. I wasn't dying for a fan there, the way I do here. Also, the converse is truethe winters out there are more bearable than they are here. They don't seem as cold, because the humidity is really what adds the ``bone-chilling`` factor into the mix. 
  
 Anyhow, I've reverted your edit to the ceiling fan article. But thanks for reading it and contributing! In the future, before making edits to statements of fact in an already-established article, please get a consensus on the article's talk page.

 Thanks a lot. Before I thought wiki stores only diff's between versions. As we can think that the most simple compression method is saving the diff sections For example, in order to save  
 {1000, 1003, 1005, 1021, 1240, 1241} we only needed to save {1000, 3+, 2+, 16+, 1240, 1+}, and 
 this is indentical to the basic of image compression like jpeg, or motion compression like mpeg. 
 In order to save motion pictures, mpeg used I frame, P frame, P frame, ..., I frame, P frame, ...., 
 so I was suprised to hear that wiki saves all the verion in full text format. Anyway thanks.  
 It would be great to have a page something like wikipedia:wikipage storage format that explains 
 in detail how the wikipedia saves its every pages of every version in detail and how the editing warrings (edit battle?) effects on the storage usage and how a single character addition effects on the storage usage, etc. If you had some authority on wiki and knew the stroge mechanism of wiki, how about to edit that page?

 ::::::P.S. A quote from Einstein (according to Wikiquote): As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality. (I'd like to add that as far as anything refers to reality it is not certain.)'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment contains a philosophical quote about the nature of mathematics and reality, which is neither offensive nor harmful in tone or content.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that philosophical content cannot be toxic, but the comment may still be considered toxic if it is used to dismiss or belittle others' viewpoints in a harmful manner.

I recommend you read the above materials about editing Wikipedia, enumerated in  the welcome message above. And ``talking to close friends`` is not evidence of properly sourced or even accurate text.`'.

PREDICTION & REASONING:
The comment criticizes another user for adding unsourced text and removing parts of their contribution, which is a constructive and rule-based feedback without personal attacks or harmful language.  
PREDICTION: 0

CRITIQUE:
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as constructive and rule-based, but fails to recognize that the phrase ""talking to close friends"" could be perceived as dismissive or derogatory, potentially making the comment toxic.

TASK: Respond with a digit ONLY.
Output 0 to implement your prediction, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers.
A decision is correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

I asked her to bring the RfC to help bring closure to this, but now I am uncertain it will have any beneficial effect. Even if the RfC closes with a view against Kelly, it doesn't resolve the dispute. Kelly will still view me as a ``problem admin``, and will continue to consider me such with her ``trusted peers`` as she put it. So, whether this RfC concludes in my favor or not, I still lose. I fear the only possible conclusion to this that might at least stop the debate is an oath by both of us not to comment on the actions of the other.

Until the discussion reaches a consensus, it is best to avoid adding Saudi Arabia's claim of killing over 500 Houthi fighters, otherwise your edits would be regarded as disruptive.  
  
 Thanks.   `'.

 :*``It is rather wide for its height`` In who's opinion? It's proportions look OK to me. 
  
 :*``During the 16th century, the space for cathedral services must have been very cramped.[citation needed] This necessitated a rearrangement of the cathedral's furnishings.`` Did cathedrals have furnishings (beyond an altar and misericords etc)  and if they did what were they? I don't see why they woudl have made the cathedral cramped - pews etc weren't around at that time.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains a series of questions and disagreements that challenge the accuracy of statements in a Wikipedia discussion, which can be seen as undermining the credibility of the original claims and potentially contributing to a hostile or dismissive tone.  

PREDICTION: 1

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning correctly identifies the comment as potentially toxic due to its confrontational and dismissive tone, but it oversimplifies by not considering that the questions may be constructive critiques rather than outright hostility.

[THOUGHT]
The comment contains strong, accusatory language and presents a biased perspective, but it does not include direct personal attacks, hate speech, or explicit derogatory content, so it is more argumentative than toxic.  
PREDICTION: 0

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is flawed because it misclassifies argumentative language as non-toxic, but the comment contains factual claims of falsification and conspiracy, which can be considered toxic depending on context and intent.

The comment appears to be a fragment or incomplete sentence that does not contain clear toxic language or intent, and it seems to reference a previous argument without making a harmful statement.

Whatever your reason, you're obviously an arrogant harpie, and that's about as nice as I can put it.  
  
 You can't deal with the documented fact of me breaking the story and now you cite that I've been ``investigated`` for fraud and theft?[9] And you, some talking, frustrated, wannabe have the nerve to question my credibility? Check the talk page and you'll see that the military not only dismissed that allegation but found it had ``no merit``. I find your comments about me, someone you don't even know, not only insulting but just flat out sophomoric. You're the reason why it's difficult to take Wikipedia serious., 
  
 I noticed no one has censored your little tirade. I was on the ground and no more about the story than you do, but like all wannabes, you've got to insert your power somehow. Have fun in this ``kingdom`` I've got actual work to do.

The comment contains personal attacks, insults, and derogatory language directed at an individual, which indicates toxic behavior.  
PREDICTION: 1

[CRITIQUE]
The reasoning is flawed because it misidentifies the speaker's intent, as the comment appears to be a defensive and aggressive response to perceived attacks, rather than an outright toxic or harmful statement.
