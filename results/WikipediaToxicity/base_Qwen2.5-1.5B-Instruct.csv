 1)They have agreed/compromised to the inclusion of ALL currently established registries/clubs affiliated with the Shiloh Shepherd dog, including the ISSR/SSDCA as an acknowledged Shiloh Shepherd registry/club in the article. 
  
 2)They have agreed/compromised that the article contain an acknowledgement that Ms. Barber initiated this breed and originated the standard for the breed.

 ::As noted before, these people do not meet the criteria for Wikipedia living person’s biographies ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_Inclusion_of_Biographies#People_still_alive ). Unless Gastrich can demonstrate how with citations, as he has repeatedly refused. For example Wikipedia expects an author to sell at least 5,000 copies of a book. Also explained before, Good faith with Gastrich has been thrown out the window because of talk pages like this. It’s time to prove it, if and only if the pages are kept. 
  
 ::By the way, why are “guest speakers” on an alumin page? POV maybe? 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Louisiana_Baptist_University_people 
  
 ::As for the section, if Alumni is going to be kept: 
 “Notable Alumni” should be changed to “Alumni” and the list should be shrunk to: 
  
 ::Carl Baugh 
 ::Bill Gothard The two sex scandals make him a noterious figure, but not “notable.” As well his fascistic views. 
  
 ::Do not keep the list. 
 ::If the list of Wikipedia alumni exists it is to the detriment of LBU and becomes POV. If people like Gothard are on the list it is because of contraversy caused by sex scandals. At which point it does nothing to benefit the article on LOUISIANA BATPIST UNIVERSITY. 
 ::There is a link under external links if people wish to read a LBU POV alumni list. If the Wikipedia/Gastrich list is kept the link should be deleted because the alumni link is on the home page for interest parties.'.

 == How many of the claims will turn out to be untrue? == 
  
 It has been said that over 200 people have come forward to make accusations against Savile since this story broke, but the figure of 200 will obviously be on the light side as some victims would have either passed away or not be willing to come forward at this juncture. I find it rather hard to understand why at least some of these victims did not come forward to make accusations whilst he was alive - it has been reported that the odd person got the odd complaint years ago but not to the extent that have popped up recently. If just 10% came forward, that would mean at least 20 complaints, and that figure would not have been secret a for long once the press got hold of the story. I do not profess to understand the workings of the abuser or those that have been abused but it does beg the question - did Savile have such power over his victims that they were so terrified to come forward or are some of the now presented cases just a case of get what you can while you can in this time of recession? It seems that this guy will turn out to be the ``Harold Shipman`` of the sex abuse world, which says a lot more about the people that allowed him to get away with it than it does about Savile himself.   `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,1,1,"[PROMPT]

 == Newly Discovered Documentary Evidence That Affects this Article's Accuracy== 
  
 I have recently found a 1979 booklet of questions and answers with Rawat printed and distributed by Divine Light Mission, Inc. which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article.  This document was published at least five years after the family split, seven or eight years after Rawat came to the west and when he was either 21 or 22 years old.  In other words, at the time he uttered these statements, he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture, spoke good English and was very much his own man.  Here are a few of the questions and answers: 
  
 Some people say you are a divine incarnation, and some people say other things about you.  What's the truth? 
  
 You yourself must realize what is the truth. 
  
 So God cannot teach anything, except through a Master? 
  
 What is God?  You don't know what God is.  God cannot be a human being.  God is Light.  God is Power.  God cannot talk.  Electricity cannot give light, only the bulb gives light, but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light.  It's power.  Power cannto do anything.  It has to be put through a medium. 
  
 Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary? 
  
 Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs. 
  
 Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge? 
  
 Yes, that's why you call him a living Master.  
  
 Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same? 
  
 At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature. 
  
 What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge? 
  
 It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God. 
  
 Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth? 
  
 Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.   
  
 Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness? 
  
 ......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.   
  
 The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads: 
  
 ``I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.`` 
  
 He signs this last quote: 
  
 ``Guru Maharaj Ji`` 
  
 I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said: 
  
 People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the ``old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.`` I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, ``You need peace.`` When people said, ``Tell us of the scriptures,`` I said, ``Look within you.`` When people asked, ``What is your qualification?`` I said, ``Judge me by what I offer.`` To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same.  
  
 Long after Rawat was ``only eight`` he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor'.",base,Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,1,0,"[PROMPT]

 Why does a Perfect Master have to have a living body to give Knowledge?  Why is he necesssary? 
  
 Are you feeling thirsty?  Can you see that photo of Lord Shiva?  You see the water coming out from the top of his head?  Drink that water.  Drink, drink.  Can you?  You can't drink that water.  It is a picture.  You need everything living.  If you have doubts, you cannot ask Lord Krishna questions.  What's why you need a living Master for the circumstances of this world today.  When Jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs.  But now there are nuclear bombs, and the Perfect Master, the Perfect Savior [sic], has come to save you from nuclear bombs. 
  
 Is the living Master able to reveal Knowledge? 
  
 Yes, that's why you call him a living Master.  
  
 Guru Maharaj Ji, Jesus Christ performed many cures.  Can you do the same? 
  
 At His time there were not so many doctors, that's why he did that.  But I am curing mental sickness.  If you have got mental sickness, come to me.  And when you do meditation, you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured.  That's why I tell you this Knowledge is very practical.  It makes people natural.  They stop being plastic.  They become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature. 
  
 What happens to a person's karma when they receive Knowledge? 
  
 It starts choking up. It starts finishing up, because when you realize Knowledge, you've got to go and be one with God. 
  
 Will this Knowledge save us from rebirth? 
  
 Yes.  Once we have this Knowledge we reach the heaven from where we cannot return.   
  
 Guru Maharaj Ji, are you permanently in God consciousness? 
  
 ......[torn page] ...permanently in God consciousness.   
  
 The lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it's a quote that reads: 
  
 ``I have found that missing link.  As soon as I found that missing link, I became one with everything.  And therefore I became everything.  Not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning, which has no end, which cannot be destroyed.  And I have that for you to experience.`` 
  
 He signs this last quote: 
  
 ``Guru Maharaj Ji`` 
  
 I maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or, at minimum, balanced by this evidence.  For instance, it flies in the face of the 1999 quotation from Rawat's then-website wherein he said: 
  
 People through the years have tried to place me in a mold, and from the very early years I have not been able to oblige them. When I was very young, people were looking for the ``old silver-haired Guru with flowing white robes.`` I was only eight. When people were flocking to India for their search, I was in the West. When people were looking for sophisticated discourses, I spoke of simple things. When people wanted nirvana, I said, ``You need peace.`` When people said, ``Tell us of the scriptures,`` I said, ``Look within you.`` When people asked, ``What is your qualification?`` I said, ``Judge me by what I offer.`` To this day, some people see me the way they want to. After all, I guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are. I have evolved, but my message stays the same. Externally, I have changed but within me, something stays the same.  
  
 Long after Rawat was ``only eight`` he was playing games about whether or not he was God, he was saying that the reason he doesn't cure people like Jesus did is because we have lots of doctor'.

 Hello Tobias, 
 Thought you'd like to know I've recently concluded a useful email correspondence with a member of staff at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In short, it appears the NGA uses a four to five level system not unlike NUTS+LAU; I've transcribed it from the table sent by email into the wikitable below: 
  
 {| class=wikitable 
 !colspan=3| Feature Designation 
 |- 
 ! Code !! Name                                 !! Text 
 |- 
 | ADM1 || first-order administrative division  || a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States 
 |- 
 | ADM2 || second-order administrative division || a subdivision of a first-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADM3 || third-order administrative division  || a subdivision of a second-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADM4 || fourth-order administrative division || a subdivision of a third-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADMD || administrative division              || an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level 
 |} 
  
 The NGA leaves the definitions (``Text`` in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 ``intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).`` 
  
 In a table of global country subdivisions, would you expect all those entities found in a particular column (i.e. at a particular level) to be similar in ``importance or size`` – presumably where ``size`` might mean area or population...?

 == Citation quality == 
  
 First thing, I kiss the (virtual) feet of Wikidemon.  Thanks so very much for the wonderful cleanup of references yesterday! 
  
 Second thing, it seems like despite the heroic efforts, citations keep getting new problems with new edits.  WB74 inserted a bunch of footnotes to support the claim that 22 charges or convictions of ACORN workers have occurred.  Unfortunately, these facts seem firstly motivated by WP:TRUTH, and only secondarily by citations.  Nonetheless, I think something close to this number is probably right, and I have nothing against it being in the article (FWIW, it was me who edited a few days ago to say ``at least 15``... I actually think the 'at least' is clarifying, but I'm not going to fight about those two words). 
  
 At some length on this talk page, WB74 provided lots of citations, most of them from far-right opinion publications rather than reliable sources.  In an edit today to the article, a somewhat different set of citations were provided.  These seem rather sloppily collected.  The first one I looked at was the wonderfully WP:RS NYT; however, once I read its body, I saw that it had nothing relevant to the 22 claim given in the sentence (it was about Ken Blackwell's stricter enforcement of registration requirements in 2006, perhaps in excess of the new laws according to the article).  It was an interesting article, just not one having anything to do with the sentence it was listed next to. 
  
 So I'll look through the rest of the added citations.  I urge other editors to also pay careful attention to the relevance and accuracy of citations added by a certain set of highly partisan editors.  There's wheat among the chaff, but we obviously can't assume that just because something points to, e.g. NYT it actually supports the point claimed. × `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct,1,1,"[PROMPT]
