 ==Wikistalkers by erstwhile administrators deserve severe sanctions== 
  
 I have been wikistalked by an administrator Hu12 and his coconspirator, Barek.  The dispute arose because I had put in a link to a Central Michigan University timeline on lighthouses in Michigan in an article on Marquette, Michigan  the link was perfectly appropriate, and was not a commercial site or spam.  I received a note from Barek saying he had deleted the link on the Discussion page.  I told him it was a perfectly fine link and that his action was ill-advised.  The next thing I knew, Hu12 intervened.  The two of them started Wikistalking me together, removing not just the link, but removing the link from every page where I had put it.  Additionally, they started doing blind ``Undos`` and obliterating large portions of articles that I had contributed.  There was no reason for any of this.  When I protested their course of action, they suspended my editing privileges.  This was done precipitously.  BK Conrad has investigated this matter, and deems the blind edits to be 'unfortunate.' 
  
 I complained to BK Conrad, an administrator.  He undid the suspension, but did not deal with my substantive complaint about this administrator.  He suggested that I could contact you. 
  
 I would also add that Hu12 deleted my complaints to him from his talk page (I put them back), and has now (conveniently) archived the pages. 
  
 Additionally, one of my correspondents, Asher196, had noted in the history section of an article that the deletion was unwarranted.  I contacted him and reported the Wikistalking. 
  
 Indeed, what you will uncover, should you choose to look, is that Hu12 and Barker were engaged in wholesale eradication of my contribution from articles, sometimes to the point where the article virtually disappeared. There was no excuse for this.  It is the very definition of Wikistalking. 
  
 As I said, when I protested this, I was suspended. 
  
 I have done a whole lot of editing here.  Many thousands of edits.  I have never before been accused of spamming the system.  I wasn't doing this here, either. 
  
 While I agree with BK that it would be best if I could just avoid these bullies, the matter is not so easily resolved.  They sought me out.  They attacked me.  They abused their administrative privileges. 
  
 While I could turn a blind eye to this, it will only encourage this untoward behavior.  When Czeckoslovakia falls, Poland can't be far behind.  Someone needs to report this and stop this untoward and unspeakable behavior.  Based on my reading of Hu12's talk page (before it disappeared), the man has attitude problems that have surfaced before. 
  
 Wikistalking by administrators will frustrate the contributors, and cause them to quit Wikipedia.  They've already done that to me.  Let there not be a repetition.  The very lifeblood of your organization is at stake. 
  
 I have attacked copies of my correspondence to and from BK Conrad and Asher196. 
  
 If you need further information, please advise. 
  
 I will send this to Asher196 and BKConrad, so they are informed of my complaint. 
   Stan 
  
 BK: 
 Thank you. 
  
 However, this has soured me, and I will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. I quit. They've achieved their victory, and Wiki will lose my modest contributions. 
  
 That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles. This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong. 
  
 I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars. 
  
 Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up. 
  
 Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges. 
  
 What they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.

 :The version that you are attempting to revert to is unstable. Your Talmudic source might be correct but it does not have any relevance to the article. You are attempting to edit against consensus. If you continue to revert then I will report you for WP:3RR and edit-warring. Thank you.   
  
 ::You've made three mistakes: 
   
 ::#Is the version I'd reverted to - unstable? On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable? 
 ::#Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on  (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on  (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it? 
 ::#The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page. 
  
 ::*Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I ``continue to revert``, also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you ``continue to revert``. 
 ::*If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus. 
 ::*Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

On the contrary: the version that you were attempting to revert to - is unstable, because the chapter you'd removed, was added three years ago (on 5 May 2008), and lasted until 14 March 2011, i.e. until the day before yestreday, whereas the version you were attempting to revert to - lasted for less than 40 hours only - that were uncontinuous and broken, so which version is more stable? 
 ::#Returning the chapter you'd removed - is not against the consensus at all. The chapter is supported by User:(MOB)DeadMeat, and is also supported by User:Chrishatch1973, and is also supported by User:Eliko; whereas the removal of the chapter is supported by User:Basket of Puppies only. Really, it was also supported (in the past) by User:DragonflySixtyseven, however their reason for the removal - was refuted on  (and on the article talk page as well), and they didn't respond to the refutation. According to the law: Silence gives consent, the very fact that User:DragonflySixtyseven didn't respond to the refutation - shows that User:DragonflySixtyseven does not reject the explanation given on  (and on the article talk page as well) for returning the chapter. To sum up, three editors (User:(MOB)DeadMeat, User:Chrishatch1973 and User:Eliko) support the chapter, and one single user (User:Basket of Puppies) rejects it, so which option is more consensual? Returning the chapter, or removing it? 
 ::#The chapter you removed is relevant, as I'd explained on the article talk page - before you removed the chapter. If you think the chapter is irrelevant - despite my explanation (on the article talk page) why it's relevant, then please discuss that on the article talk page. 
  
 ::*Note that when you responded to me on my talk page - each one of us had made one revert only - during 2011, so: considering that the single revert I've made during 2011 - was sufficient for you to warn me of your reporting me for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if I ``continue to revert``, also your single revert you've made during 2011 - should be sufficient for me to warn you of my reporting you for WP:3RR and edit-warring - if you ``continue to revert``. 
 ::*If you continue to both - remove a consensual chapter - and replace it by an unstable version which is against the consensus, then I will report you for violating Wikipedia policy, that requires - to discuss everything on the article talk page - before removing a consensual chapter and before replacing it by an unstable version which is against the consensus. 
 ::*Anyways: due to your claim about irrelevance, I will add to the (stable consensual) chapter - some clarifications, to make sure that every reader (including User:Basket of Puppies) understands its relevance.

 Now she is excoriating my character...again. 
  
 Sarek, probably an interaction ban is appropriate as suggested. I do have questions concerning that: does whomever race to the Karel article first get to be the only editor?. I see she just received an interaction ban with yet another user. She has stalked me to two other obscure articles,(Margaret Clark and John Tran), edit warred without repercussions, hence totally discouraging me from editing other articles in which I am interested. When I reported the obvious stalking, I received no relief.  You pointed out that she has accused me of edit warring alone. I have never been extended good faith, civility  or any other ``pillars`` from this editor. She constantly threatens me. She flagrantly violated the 3RR just yesterday with no repercussions to her personally.  
 I made a lot of mistakes at first, apologized and moved on. I have studied this maze called Wiki, learned and grown a lot, yet she is still accusing me of the ``same old, same old`` from two years ago. (See Karel's talk page.) Seaphoto, FeralDruid and AFriedman and others, have been a tremendous help, even when they were upset with me, as I know you have been.  BlackKite was a big help but I understand he got disgusted and left. As a ``newbie`` I was viciously attacked and stayed away for several months.  Right now,  I cannot figure out many of the procedures for complaints i.e. 3RR, without some assistance, I tried tonight. I have taught at University, I was Valedictorian of my college class and am continually talked down to as if I were an idiot child.  I sincerely endeavor to write honestly, with NPOV and no weaselly or peacock remarks. I strive for the TRUTH.  I am asking for help here.

 Now she is excoriating my character...again. 
  
 Sarek, probably an interaction ban is appropriate as suggested. I do have questions concerning that: does whomever race to the Karel article first get to be the only editor?. I see she just received an interaction ban with yet another user. She has stalked me to two other obscure articles,(Margaret Clark and John Tran), edit warred without repercussions, hence totally discouraging me from editing other articles in which I am interested. When I reported the obvious stalking, I received no relief.  You pointed out that she has accused me of edit warring alone. I have never been extended good faith, civility  or any other ``pillars`` from this editor. She constantly threatens me. She flagrantly violated the 3RR just yesterday with no repercussions to her personally.  
 I made a lot of mistakes at first, apologized and moved on. I have studied this maze called Wiki, learned and grown a lot, yet she is still accusing me of the ``same old, same old`` from two years ago. (See Karel's talk page.) Seaphoto, FeralDruid and AFriedman and others, have been a tremendous help, even when they were upset with me, as I know you have been.  BlackKite was a big help but I understand he got disgusted and left. As a ``newbie`` I was viciously attacked and stayed away for several months.  Right now,  I cannot figure out many of the procedures for complaints i.e. 3RR, without some assistance, I tried tonight. I have taught at University, I was Valedictorian of my college class and am continually talked down to as if I were an idiot child.  I sincerely endeavor to write honestly, with NPOV and no weaselly or peacock remarks. I strive for the TRUTH.  I am asking for help here.

 *Mel Gibson is Only Human 
 While Mr. Gibson did make wrong, anti-semetic comments, he did so drunk, and he does not speak openly about any kind of anti-semetic views when sober.

 ::He's an adult. The law doesn't make a distinction betwen words & acts said and committed when drunk and when sober; neither should we. He is quoted on a police report as making remarks that are undeniably anti semitic. Therefore, he is anti-semitic.

 :::::In which case, this little ditty from the article also seems to help...a prominent jewish leader calling him an anti-semite: In response, Abraham Foxman of the Anti-Defamation League, who was one of The Passion'''s most vocal critics, released a statement saying that Gibson's apology was ``unremorseful and insufficient`` and that the group hoped that ``Hollywood now would realize the bigot in their midst and that they will distance themselves from this anti-Semite.``  
 ::::::Gibson said that he has disgraced himself and his family and he is sorry for what he did. What more do does Foxman want? Yes, and hollywood has such high standards to hold up...this is the kind of ammunition Foxman craved as soon as he started criticizing the Passion.

 :Yeah, like George Bush might get drunk and suddenly shout out ``I love Islam!`` because when you're drunk you typically say the opposite of what you believe?   
  
 It's funny to read the arguments here about if Mr. Gibson is anti-Semitic or not given the known views of his ``Traditionalist`` Catholic church.

 Hi all, 
  
 I am handling an OTRS ticket from a senior employee with Tiger's company ETW Corp., regarding the name of Tiger in this article. It is contended unequivocally that ``Tont is not Tiger's middle name`` and that ``his official middle name has always been Tiger``.  
  
 I have analyzed the references presented here, and two of the three used make no mention of Tont.

 I propose that both the ``Tont`` from the lead, and the short sentence relating to how he got it, both of which are sourced to the in-passing remark in that book, be removed. I ask for your comments in forming a consensus before doing so, however.\

 == Defending the 1905 French Law of Separation of Religion and State == 
  
 ::International Humanist News  The 16th World Humanist Congress was held in Paris in July 2005 on the theme of Separation of Religion and State. Commemorating the centenary of the 1905 French law which established such a separation, the World Congress passed an important declaration which has been published in the International Humanist News of August 2005. The 1905 law establishes laicité, or the institutional Separation of Church and State, a defining characteristic of the French republic. Of seminal importance in the ongoing and permanent battle for the freedom of conscience, Laicité is under attack today. Roger Lepeix writes of the dangers, and of the spectacular efforts by French Freethinkers to save a valuable institutional arrangement.

 You regret? www That's a good one. You visit here with the ID as I'm getting to almost forget this matter. Your appearance always draw my attention back to the ancient history of Japan. Yeah, I'm studying it hard. I have to take a nap, so see yeah soooooooooon 
  
  
 And, this Korean is repeating harassment to the ancient history of Japan. 
  
 ===1. ``百濟國主照古王 以牡馬壹疋 牝馬壹疋 付阿知吉師以貢上`` === 
 The document of this China was rewritten to an opposite meaning by .  
  
  
 The meaning of ``貢上`` is ``dedicated``.However, he rewrote ``dedicated`` in ``granted``.  
 The meaning of ``granted`` is ``下賜``. 
  
  did a similarly wrong translation, and ruined Imperial House of Japan.  
  said. the 30th Japanese emperor Bidatsu was also a Korean. The section has many potential to be expanded indeed, so what is your rationale? 
  
 He translated ``大原真人 出自謚敏達孫百済王也``. (Quotation 新撰姓氏録) into ``大原真人 is Korean emperor(百済王) Bidatsu(敏達)'s grandchild``. Of course, Appletrees's translation is completely wrong. A correct translation is ``大原真人 is a descendant of the grandchild ``百済王`` of emperor Bidatsu(敏達)``.  
  
 === 2. Korean civilization === 
 ``The Encyclopedia of World History: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern`` P56  is being written.  
 Via these Korean contacts, Japan opened her doors to continental culture and Chinese civilization. This also enabled direct contacts with China.  
  
 And, ``JapaneseHistory.info``  is being written.  
 Chinese and Korean immigrants played an important role in introducing Chinese civilization to early Japan. 
  
 Though a Korean civilization was not written at all, He rewrote, ``A Korean civilization introduced the culture to Japan``.  
  
  often misinterprets the source.  
 For instance Shakuhachi  
  
 ``Diplomatic and cultural exchanges between Chinese continent and Japan being common, we can think that this flute was introduced in Japan with other musical instruments that were intended to give entertainments at the court (Gagaku; court music).`` 
  
 This source is not writing Korea at all. However, he rewrote it.  
 ``The bamboo flute first came to Japan from China via Korea. The shakuhachi proper, however, is quite distinct from its Chinese and Korean ancestors, the result of centuries of isolated evolution in Japan.

 Just reading this article I've noticed that it fails to mention many of the controversies of cityrail, accusations of sexual harrassment within its staff, chronicle delays, major incidents (such as the breakdown in transport following Queen Mary II etc). When it does mention criticism of CityRail it almost invariably provies (and in many cases gives emphasis to) a counterargument, particularly when the section dedicated to criticism is called ``Challenges`` and portrays CityRail as being able to best them in all situations. 
  
 The way I see it the article reads more as a commercial advertisement, fails to mention many controversial issues surrounding CityRail, and continually praises the corporation through colourful language. This may be just me, but at least add in information about accusations relating to sexism and harrassment in the working culture, public scrutiny of services etc 
  
 @ JPG: my apologies for not signing the statement last time, I did not have a regular account and (given this may be more than a minor edit) was trying to borrow my brother's, so I could sign it later. Although I have not made major contributions I have made many minor edits and am well acquainted with the way of wikipedia, and this article clearly, given both this knowledge and the various criticism that CityRail has faced, is biased towards painting the corporation in a positive light. I would appreciate it if you replied instead of deleting under the false presumption of vandalism, and if others who are not regular editors of this article could have their say
