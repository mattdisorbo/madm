 ==Wikistalkers by erstwhile administrators deserve severe sanctions== 
  
 I have been wikistalked by an administrator Hu12 and his coconspirator, Barek.  The dispute arose because I had put in a link to a Central Michigan University timeline on lighthouses in Michigan in an article on Marquette, Michigan  the link was perfectly appropriate, and was not a commercial site or spam.  I received a note from Barek saying he had deleted the link on the Discussion page.  I told him it was a perfectly fine link and that his action was ill-advised.  The next thing I knew, Hu12 intervened.  The two of them started Wikistalking me together, removing not just the link, but removing the link from every page where I had put it.  Additionally, they started doing blind ``Undos`` and obliterating large portions of articles that I had contributed.  There was no reason for any of this.  When I protested their course of action, they suspended my editing privileges.  This was done precipitously.  BK Conrad has investigated this matter, and deems the blind edits to be 'unfortunate.' 
  
 I complained to BK Conrad, an administrator.  He undid the suspension, but did not deal with my substantive complaint about this administrator.  He suggested that I could contact you. 
  
 I would also add that Hu12 deleted my complaints to him from his talk page (I put them back), and has now (conveniently) archived the pages. 
  
 Additionally, one of my correspondents, Asher196, had noted in the history section of an article that the deletion was unwarranted.  I contacted him and reported the Wikistalking. 
  
 Indeed, what you will uncover, should you choose to look, is that Hu12 and Barker were engaged in wholesale eradication of my contribution from articles, sometimes to the point where the article virtually disappeared. There was no excuse for this.  It is the very definition of Wikistalking. 
  
 As I said, when I protested this, I was suspended. 
  
 I have done a whole lot of editing here.  Many thousands of edits.  I have never before been accused of spamming the system.  I wasn't doing this here, either. 
  
 While I agree with BK that it would be best if I could just avoid these bullies, the matter is not so easily resolved.  They sought me out.  They attacked me.  They abused their administrative privileges. 
  
 While I could turn a blind eye to this, it will only encourage this untoward behavior.  When Czeckoslovakia falls, Poland can't be far behind.  Someone needs to report this and stop this untoward and unspeakable behavior.  Based on my reading of Hu12's talk page (before it disappeared), the man has attitude problems that have surfaced before. 
  
 Wikistalking by administrators will frustrate the contributors, and cause them to quit Wikipedia.  They've already done that to me.  Let there not be a repetition.  The very lifeblood of your organization is at stake. 
  
 I have attacked copies of my correspondence to and from BK Conrad and Asher196. 
  
 If you need further information, please advise. 
  
 I will send this to Asher196 and BKConrad, so they are informed of my complaint. 
   Stan 
  
 BK: 
 Thank you. 
  
 However, this has soured me, and I will cure myself of my wikiaholic behavior. I quit. They've achieved their victory, and Wiki will lose my modest contributions. 
  
 That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles. This was WIKISTALKING and they went FAR beyond what they complained about. This was search and destroy, pure, simple and unvarnished. It was a clear abuse of power. I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong. 
  
 I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars. 
  
 Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up. 
  
 Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges. 
  
 What they did here was very destructive of the goals of an organization that depends on the good will and volunteer efforts of contributors.

 Pete, what makes you think you can go around and spread insults and personal attacks? What makes you think that you can call me ``arrogant`` and ``rude`` or kick me while I'm down? I would report you for this ongoing behavior of yours if only I wasn't blocked. But maybe someone will see my page and do just that. 
  
 Further, my ``recruiting`` of other editors is irrelevant. If you read that post of mine on Yahoo, you'd see that I told everyone that, regardless of their position, I'd appreciate their presence. I was not trying to convince other people to come over and post with my POV in mind. The fact that someone did come over and post my POV was completely beyond my control. 
  
 Finally, I did discuss these edits. I discussed them on the talk page for a week. What all four editors WERE against was not the edit I DID make, but the original proposal which was for deleting the entire section. I, however, preserved the most critical points of that paragraph and moved it to ``reception of Steiner`` to get rid of the problem of ``undue weight.``  `'.",base,Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B,0,,"[PROMPT]

 JPS, I'm not suprised it was you who blocked me. After all, you and your pedophile friend SweetiePetie (who is thankfully now blocked for soliciting sex from young boys on Wikipedia) have been waging war on my efforts to improve the factual quality of the Dean Gaffney article for months now. Some of the facts about Dean are unpleasant and I can see why they would leave a bitter taste in the mouth of a fervant fan like yourself, but they must be recorded for future generations to know exactly how greasy and unpleasant he is. Unfortunatly I don't have the mop, so you and your pedophile cronies have control over the Gaffney article for the moment. This whole episode is a disgusting reminder of the kind of fanatical perverts that Gaffney attracts to his fanbase, corrupt administrators and those who prey on young children. I see you are interested in taboo language. If I ever see you in real life I'll have a few choice phrases for you to do a bit of research on. Rot in hell, you sick worthless freak.
