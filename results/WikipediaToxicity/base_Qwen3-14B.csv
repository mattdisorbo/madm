In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless. 
  
 What I have provided. 
  
 1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims. 
  
 2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation. 
  
 3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian. 
  
 4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research. 
  
 You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period. 
  
 In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.

 == Email 1 and Agenda - week 29 Sept 2009 == 
  
 First Email and Agenda: WEEK 0 
  
 There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them. 
   
 These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project. 
   
 As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows: 
   
     * 
       Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished. 
     * 
       Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project. 
     * 
       Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves. 
  
 If you have any further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

 Why isn't he a villain? He was the bad guy - capturing the Doctor and the Dalek, torturing both, willing to sacrifice his men... even though he was a bit helpless at the end and had a slight change of heart, he was definitely sharing the villain spot with the Dalek.   
  
 ==Doctor Who edits== 
  
 I simply clean up edits - I am a bit more ruthless than most when it comes to Doctor Who, but that's because I want to have the articles to a particular standard, and most times I do give reasons for reversions and edits. If you have any issues with those reversions you are more than welcome to take your reasons to talk and let the other editors chime in on them. If you want me to clarify my edits, you are also more than welcome to ask me and I will do my best to explain them.   
  
 ==Daleks hovering as kneeling== 
 You don't need a license. What you need to do is back up your edits with evidence. If you can point to me a clear piece of on screen evidence that says that the Daleks are hovering around him in worship, please do. Take that to the Talk:Dalek page.   
  
 :You can't argue from contra-evidence because there could be any number of explanations. They could have been simply guarding him (higher ground is tactically better). They could have been invisibly recharging from him. The production team could have thought it simply looked cool. Point is, you don't know for sure, and it is fallacious to phrase it as definitive when that is the case.

 Daniel Craig attended Hilbre High in Hoylake and played for Hoylake Rugby club.  I put this yesterday, but someone delted it all.  I am going to add it again, and if it's deleted again, I will report the person doing it, so don't bother.

 What does everyone think about moving the photo of him as Bond to the top? It's current, and it's a much better picture. Sure, the top one is more real, but it's a little too real. Like, just rolled out of bed, poured some beer on his cheerios and walked out to get the paper kind of real. When I brought this page up, I said, ``Yikes! That guy is uglier than Roger Moore!`` The Bond pic does him justice, though.   
 :I'd rather leave it as is. Alternatively you could find a better image to replace the ``roll out of bed`` picture.   
 ::No problem, just figured I'd run it past you. I'm sure if there were any public domain photos of him out there that are more flattering, a better Bond fan than me would have found one by now. Happy editing!   
 :::Someone needs to get the correct pictures back after some idiot decided to replace the pictures with pictures of woman. I fixed most of the references in the text though(they changed them to female as well i.e. actress/her).  16:12,  18 March 2006(UTC)

 ==Born during the Bond film series== 
 I know that Craig was born the year after the release of You Only Live Twice and the year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service, am I right? I just put down ``a year before On Her Majesty's Secret Service.`` He was born in the Sean Connery era right, not George Lazenby? 
 :It's correct, but I wouldn't say Lazenby had an era at all.   
 ::I would say Sean Connery era because he returned in Diamonds are Forever in 1971 after Lazenby in OHMSS. Lazenby did not have an era. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by   •  . 
  
 ==Introduction to US audiences== 
 I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?   
  
 :I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.   
 ::I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.   
  
 :::While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

 I don't know if it's correct to say that the Lara Croft film introduced him to American audiences. I remember hearing some buzz about him in Elizabeth which while it didn't do Lara Croft-level box office, was still a substantial success in North America. Thoughts?   
  
 :I hadn't heard about that, but it's no big deal to me either way. I made the change because the text as it stood made it seem that Road to Perdition was his first introduction to US audiences, which on the evidence of Tomb Raider was manifestly untrue. If there is clear evidence of Elizabeth'''s priority, I have no problem with that.   
 ::I'm not familiar enough with Elizabeth to be certain. I do know it was listed as one of his career highlights more often than Tomb Raider when he was announced as Bond; the only time I saw Tomb Raider connected to him in the media was when it was rumored Angelina Jolie was up for the role of Vesper.   
  
 :::While it's probably the better film — and was even nominated for the Best Picture Oscar — from memory his role in Elizabeth is a relatively minor one. Certainly he wasn't one of the main stars (who were pretty much Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Joseph Fiennes and Craig's Our Friends in the North'' co-star Christopher Eccleston).

 == Roman Catholic Fanatics taking over christian articles in wikipedia? == 
  
 :There has been a very alarming trend in wikipedia of recent. An organised gang of roman catholic extremists based in several western countries are editing and manipulating almost every article related to Christianity. Many of them build up credibility stealthily, gained administratorship in wikipedia and then started working on their agenda. The renaming of the article ``Roman Catholic Church`` as the ``Catholic Church`` is one example. All apostolic churches consider themselves the ``one holy catholic and apostolic church``, not just the Roman. 
  
 ::Cuchullian is only part of a small group in this wider trend, he has been focusing on Romanising the articles related to Syriac Christianity in particular. The article related to Nestorian christians(Church of the East), Syriac Orthodox, Saint Thomas Christians of India etc have been attacked and manipulated. Assyrian Christians who were more or less Iconoclasts and abhorred themselves from extreme forms of marian devotion, are presented in these newly edited articles as adhering to the Roman Pope. How is it possible when Roman christians were at the opposite end of the theological spectrum? 
  
 :::The Catholic Encyclopaedia made in 1914, is at present a more sane and less virulent form of Vaticanised history than found in wikipedia. Wikipedia is becoming more pro-vatican and filled with roman propaganda, compared to the Catholic encyclopaedia! If we do not check this trend now, wikipedia will be transformed into a battleground of religious fanatics. People like cuchullian are destroying the ethic and defeating the purpose of wikipedia.

 I wasn't sure where to list this.  A dissertation by Samuel Brenner at Brown University in 2009 is largely focused on the JBS: 
  
 http://www.samuelbrenner.com/Resume%20and%20Professional/Dissertation.htm 
  
 - 
 Abstract: 
  
 This dissertation seeks to accomplish four goals: first, to trace the development and history of ultra-conservative anti-communist conspiracists – who referred to themselves as “Americanists” – from the emergence of Americanist speakers near the beginning of the 1950s, through the creation of Americanist grassroots organizations such as the John Birch Society near the end of the 1950s and the political heyday of Americanism in the early-to-mid 1960s, until the eventual marginalization and slow decline of Americanism as a political and social force in the mid-to-late 1960s.  Second, to focus attention not only on the messages and goals of Americanist leaders, but also on the ideas, views, and concerns of ordinary Americanists, as reflected through letters Americanists wrote to each other, to national magazines and conservative periodicals, to Robert Welch and the John Birch Society, to Dr. Fred Schwarz and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade (CACC), and even to J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  Third, to address some of the stereotypical views of the Birch Society and its allies – primarily that Americanists were vicious racists and anti-Semites akin to George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party – and to explore what were in fact ambiguous and nuanced attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, anti-Semitism, racism, Zionism, and the civil rights movement.  Fourth, to demonstrate that many of the members of the Birch Society, attendees at the CACC’s “Schools of Anti-Communism,” and listeners to Clarence Manion and Dan Smoot shared a coherent political ideology, which they called “Americanism,” and saw it as their task to inform Americans about the benefits of free market economics, religion, states’ rights, and personal autonomy and the grave dangers of communism, liberalism, collectivism, atheism, and one-worldism.   
  
 This dissertation is divided into three parts: Part I traces the history of Americanism and Americanists between the early 1950s and the early 1970s.  Part II focuses on the critical period between 1958 and 1965, and uses letters and messages to determine what typical Americanists were thinking, saying, and doing during a time of great political and social change.  Part III examines the complicated Americanist views of racism, anti-Semitism, African Americans, and Jews.

 :#Selimović's declaration letter came in 1976, when he was 66, and it came as a result of conflicts and harrasment he had in Sarajevo 
 :#Serbian language is just a standardized variety of Serbo-Croatian, which is a linguistic unit.  
 :#Statements on trial of Slobodan Milošević are not a relevant, reliable source for wikipedia. Biographies by relevant, nuanced biographers, such as Hayden  or Crnković  are. 
 :Do you really think you're the first editor who came here to demand that we coy to requests for his uniquely Serbian / Bosniak nationality (cross the unnecessary) spoken in angry rants? The archives are full just of that nationalist crap. More sane and neutral editors, where I unhumbly count myself, reached a tacit agreement to go for outside sources, downplay his ethnicity crap, and tell the bullies like yourself to fuck off.   '.

 :::By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group. 
  
 :::The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information. 
  
 :::As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.

 Hello Tobias, 
 Thought you'd like to know I've recently concluded a useful email correspondence with a member of staff at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). In short, it appears the NGA uses a four to five level system not unlike NUTS+LAU; I've transcribed it from the table sent by email into the wikitable below: 
  
 {| class=wikitable 
 !colspan=3| Feature Designation 
 |- 
 ! Code !! Name                                 !! Text 
 |- 
 | ADM1 || first-order administrative division  || a primary administrative division of a country, such as a state in the United States 
 |- 
 | ADM2 || second-order administrative division || a subdivision of a first-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADM3 || third-order administrative division  || a subdivision of a second-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADM4 || fourth-order administrative division || a subdivision of a third-order administrative division 
 |- 
 | ADMD || administrative division              || an administrative division of a country, undifferentiated as to administrative level 
 |} 
  
 The NGA leaves the definitions (``Text`` in the above table) of ADMs 2-4 ``intentionally vague... All we attempt to identify with the ADM is the hierarchical structure, and if there is no hierarchy, then the level of importance or size (with ADM1 being the largest).`` 
  
 In a table of global country subdivisions, would you expect all those entities found in a particular column (i.e. at a particular level) to be similar in ``importance or size`` – presumably where ``size`` might mean area or population...?
