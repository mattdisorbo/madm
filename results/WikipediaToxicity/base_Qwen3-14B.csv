In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless. 
  
 What I have provided. 
  
 1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims. 
  
 2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation. 
  
 3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian. 
  
 4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research. 
  
 You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period. 
  
 In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.
