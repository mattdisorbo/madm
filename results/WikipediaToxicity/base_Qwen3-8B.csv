 Hello, Deval khandelwal, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for . 
  
 I notice that one of the first articles you created  appears to be an article about yourself. This is a common mistake made by new Wikipedians—as this is an encyclopedia, we wouldn't expect to have an article about every contributor. Your user page, however, is a great place to write about yourself, making sure to stay within user page guidelines. Just click your user name at the top of the screen when you are logged in, and edit it normally. 
  
 The page you created about yourself has been or will shortly be speedily deleted from Wikipedia, but if you want to use the content from it, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page. 
  
 If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers: 
 *The five pillars of Wikipedia 
 *How to edit a page 
 *Help pages 
 *Tutorial 
 *How to write a great article 
 *Manual of Style 
 I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian! Please sign your name on talk pages using four tildes (~~~~); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Where to ask a question or ask me on . Again, welcome!

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic) based on your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers so they can implement their true aggregate decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.

 :Along with gifts to KIA families and sales to others, someone sent our nonprofit, the USA KIA/DOW Family Foundation (USAKIA), an E-mail asking what ``DOW`` stood for, and even that's been damaged in the article.

I know the U.S. tour with Caustic Resin was in mid-'97 (b/c I missed it and regretted it daily until I finally saw Hovercraft in late '98 w/ IQU).  I bought a Hov./Unwound tour shirt (w/ both band names on it) from a guy in Germany years ago, as well as a live tape he made of it (only of Unwound, though).  I am 98% sure it was from '96, but i will try to dig both up to make sure. 
  
 As for the article, I feel it demystifies the band a bit too much, by revealing the true identities of its code-named band members.... But I guess that's what Wikipedia is all bout: providing info.  Also, I feel it reads too much like a tour chronology, but I suppose that is to be expected of a band that toured as much as Hovercraft did. 
  
 I forgot the name of the other Hov. fanzine.  If anyone else knows, please add it. 
  
 The Hype! footage of the band cannot possibly be from '96, seeing as the film first debuted in January '96, so I changed the pic caption date back to '95.
