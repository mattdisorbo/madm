This page Clearly states that the new wave of british heavy metal is one of the components thus the ``heavy-ier`` feel than punk . Someone put in metal I thought it was already there for a long time, it kept getting removed . after some careful thought (I was there) I studied music history from Johnny Dodds to ``hardcore punk`` , I looked it to it and it makes total sense. The complaint from one page is there was no source and it was tagged I think as as ``fact claim`` . I looked to see if there was a source there was , it got removed all of a sudden by 3 pages. No explanation . Except the kind of ``cop`` out, ``Not reliable because its at about.com`` , the writer is a college educated journalist since late 80s. Not ``about.com`` he just wrote something they ``host`` . 
  
 So a completely different page gets created and reverts it anytime I put it back, so I decided to further inspect the story and online history (section) at the page in the U.K section which is part of the creation (Next to a Picture of Lemmy) says ``Referred to under a number of names including ``U.K. Hardcore``, ``UK 82``, ``second wave punk``,[66] ``real punk``,[67] and ``No Future punk``,[68] it took the previous punk sound and added the incessant, heavy drumbeats and distorted guitar sound of New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, especially Motörhead.[69]`` 
 So I felt the ``heavy metal``  may have mislead and changed it to the more appropriate NWOBHM and this new page changes it its the only thing the page has ever done , created a few days ago, no explanation, no discussion on the talk page, removing sourced material and contradicting the article itself . Now that page has done 4 reverts. in one day....Can you go and see this please. I don't always sign in to my page and I realize I may have not reached the status to be able to handle this by not getting credit for all my work here .  
 Ill probably never ask you for help again buy you seem to be Very helpful . Thank You.
