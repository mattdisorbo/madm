 Dear DF67, 
  
 Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I promise to become less ``cute,`` and write with greater focus and brevity... next time. 
  
 One of the issues that I am sure is being addressed somewhere is that the people who should be editing The Neversink Gorge page and developing the Forestburgh page are so old that they can hardly deal with email. When I begged several of these people (who hate each other) who have vital collections of one of a kind books, documents, photos, articles, etc to look at what I had written and to edit it, they ``saw/experienced`` a ``googleesque`` one way portal; then, the one man who had the courage to click edit looked, blinked, read, stopped, called me and said, ``You claim it's so easy a dog could do it. If it's so easy then have Remsen edit it.`` He hung up. 
  
 This is not an ``issue`` that can be fixed anytime soon; however, Remsen will keep working on it. 
  
 As for my ``serious`` issue, I just got a nice note from Wesley Northrop resolving it: 
  
 Dear Mr Bertine, 
 Hm, I could have sworn I'd answered you the other day. If this is a duplicate 
 message, please ignore it. 
 As far as I can tell, the account ``Petebertine`` has not been banned at all; 
 the block log is totally empty. Perhaps you have been misspelling your 
 password? 
 If you have included your e-mail address in your account, you can have a 
 password reminder sent to you. If not, well... I suppose you could start a 
 fresh account (``PeteBertine2`` or something, for instance). 
 Yours sincerely, 
 Wesley Northrop 
  
 Pete Bertine and Remsen are impressed and thrilled with this experience, gold stars to everyone. We are now more determined than ever to get an 89 year old curmudgeon to contribute to Wikipedia. 
  
 My question: can you please direct me to the best, most successful example on Wikipedia of a town, like Forestburgh, representing itself in the ``wiki-community;`` and could you provide at least 2 ``wiki-person-users`` that I should attempt to emulate in my quest to create a ``wiki-forestburgh`` full of ``wiki-correct`` content. 
  
 Sincerely,

 == Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!== 
 This article's statement in the part of ``Maratime Republics`` claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake. 
 One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book ``Suze sina razmetnoga``, was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: ``Dubrovnik, a history``, written by Robin Harris 2006. 
 According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry. 
  
 Some reflections  on this issue are necessary 
  
 First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, ``Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia`` and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.   
  
 ==Romanians in 2007/2008== 
  
 I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.   
 :If you can give a reliable source that says this, go ahead and add it (including a reference to the source). However merely ``thinking`` that it's true is not a reliable source.   |

Duemila anni di storia`` and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.   
  
 ==Romanians in 2007/2008== 
  
 I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.

 ::::I see this as an important issue that requires extreme caution. [I’m speaking generally as I haven’t had the time to try to analyze Yoyohooyo’s  specific assertions.] Of course the Massei report is biased. It’s trying to justify the court’s (prosecution) point of view. Whether or not it is deliberately MIS-leading is something we cannot prove or disprove. But by definition, it IS “leading”, i.e. it leads the reader to follow the judge’s reasoning. If the judge’s reasoning is incorrect (deliberately or not) or based on false assumptions, then the report is misleading. That would seem to be the reason for the policy on primary sources and in this case we have to follow not only the general guidance on primary sources, but the stricter rule: WP:BLP/Misuse of primary sources: Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. That seems pretty cut-and-dried. Maybe the report can be used to confirm what the court concluded, but anything more than that (including details that the court believes to be ``facts`` in reaching its conclusion) would seem to be prohibited as they are ``assertions about a living person``.  Demanding other RS’s, which may not exist, as an alternative to the Massei report is not a valid argument for using a prohibited source. At the risk of climbing on a soapbox, I will add that’s the problem with this article. We want to provide accurate, reliably-sourced facts; but too few facts are indisputably known and I fear that many of the sources we might like to rely on have been less careful in their scrutiny of officially-provided ``facts`` (what the prosecution and court have allowed to be released) than we are trying to be here. If we remove all contentious material, the article would be shorter and contain few details. And maybe that would be a good thing.   `'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,,192,"[PROMPT]

 Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.

 I edited a page, and you changed it back.  My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.  The individuals name Krista Jacobson used to be Chris Brooks.  None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.   
  
 I understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History.

 I edited a page, and you changed it back.  My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.  The individuals name Krista Jacobson used to be Chris Brooks.  None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.   
  
 I understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History. 
  
 Is there a better way that it should have been edited on my part?  
  
 Berzerker'.

 *Hi GotR. I would like to see you edit here again, as you have been doing a great job on subdivisions of China (although I believe you are exaggerating your irreplaceability: just because nobody hasn't picked up the job yet, it does not mean nobody will, and there is no WP:DEADLINE), but there are a couple of things you should think about before you are unblocked. One is that you should stop focusing on whether or not your indefblock was justified. What happened to you (blocks escalated after you didn't keep your cool while being blocked, but instead throwing red flags like new accounts in the face of all admins) isn't a case of you being singled out by an abusive admin, but actually fairly typical admin behaviour. At some point we tend to lose our patience and decide that a user is more trouble than they are worth (and the community expects us to make such decisions). You have a collection of accounts, all with block logs attached, that make it a bit wearying to even try to find out whether you were treated fairly at all times in the past.

 The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page. 
  
 Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages. 
  
 As the Zogby poll shows, 42% of America believes the government is covering up 9/11 and 45% want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved. 
  
 For now on, any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol. 
  
 Also, even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation, I do apologize for them. Anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. I expect anyone and everyone to be civil.

 == Mormonism and history merge proposal == 
 Storm, I saw your note on Trodel's page and wanted to touch base.  I am definately against merging, primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a ``one time`` issue.  The most recent pattern of ``faith-promoting`` history was (as a BYU trained historian, I sincerely hope) a one time event.  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic, closer to historiography, having implications from Joseph's time to the present.  I don't know if this is the right title for such an article, but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page.  Please drop in and give your two cents.  And, besides, there is certainly little room for more material in History of the Latter Day Saint movement!  Best wishes as always.    `'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,0.0,320,"[PROMPT]

 Let me respond again. 
  
 I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar.  
  
 I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how.  
  
 Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation.  
  
 If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'.  
  
 If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things.  
  
 Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil.  
  
 There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.

 :::All of those statements need to be referenced.  Leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information.  To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012.  First, it has a number of tags on it, the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number 1 to remove the flag.  Second, the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that.  It appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link.  It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell.  I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences.  On creation, the opening read ``Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) is a bill passed to the 112th United States Congress``  I've never heard this usage (to rather than by) and assume it is incorrect, another editor changed it, the lead is also missing an important determiner.

To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012.  First, it has a number of tags on it, the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number 1 to remove the flag.  Second, the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that.  It appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link.  It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell.  I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences.  On creation, the opening read ``Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (H.R. 2055) is a bill passed to the 112th United States Congress``  I've never heard this usage (to rather than by) and assume it is incorrect, another editor changed it, the lead is also missing an important determiner.  In any case, you can take a look at  for more of my comments on various issues.   `'.

 Now, I'm not an ``authority`` such as people here claim to be. I don't hold any PhDs, nor do I feel I posses a ``body of knowledge`` that ``is very likely to dismiss...innocent guesses, or fractal knowledge.``  I have, however, spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan, specifically Almaty. That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty. When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city, it is also written as ``Алматы`` (Almaty).  
  
 From my experience, only the Russians continue the use of Alma-Ata. As another example, the train station in Moscow says Алма-Ата (Alma-Ata). However, it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod (most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod, or ``Nizhny`` for short - I can't recall actually hearing ``Gorki`` used beyond the train station). 
  
 Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention ``the Soviet Alma-Ata``, much like Bishkek is the ``Soviet Frunze``.  
  
 As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the ``scientific`` or ``academic`` method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a ``K``  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use ``Alma-Ata`` because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?   
  
 Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged.  
  
 Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up ``Алматы`` (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up ``Алма–Ата`` (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.`'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,0.0,448,"[PROMPT]

 Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention ``the Soviet Alma-Ata``, much like Bishkek is the ``Soviet Frunze``.  
  
 As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the ``scientific`` or ``academic`` method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a ``K``  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use ``Alma-Ata`` because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?   
  
 Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged.  
  
 Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up ``Алматы`` (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up ``Алма–Ата`` (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.`'.

 WilliamJE, I wanted to let you know why I've modified some of your edits. While you're to be commended for trying to pare down Notable people lists, the usual procedure for dealing with unsourced material is to tag it first. This gives other editors notice of the issue and provides them with some time to find reliable sources.

In several instances you were very quick to delete material that didn't yet have a source. Yet I was able to quite readily find a source for the deleted material. Deleting material without notice may mean that valid information is deleted from an article because other editors weren't given notice of the issue and time to rectify it.

 It appears that Admin  has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon  simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia.

 ’s edits do not constitute vandalism 
  
 He simply restored duly referenced text.

 * Proof 2 
 * Proof 3 
  
   did not violate WP:3rr  
  
 He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing.

 * It was mentioned that  is licensed to Concord, CA and  is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another.  
 *  never participated in the edit war but instead he simply warned and warned reporting editor  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry? 
 *If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all.

 Re: Friends episodes articles. 
 I used the capitals used in the main List of Friends episodes page where prior editor(s) capitalized all the first letters of the titles.  I totally agree with your point though. I will take some time to format these correctly as well. 
 As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.  As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job. (I'm even using the little nav table)  I am going to try very hard not to just regurgitate what's already available out there.'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,0.0,384,"[PROMPT]

 This passage seems to suggest the Samaritan was the neighbor while the other two were not.

You are helping a group of crowd-workers label Wikipedia discussion comments as toxic or not. This comment needs to be checked: '` 
  
 Addendum: Changed definition of 'palpitations' in parentheses from ``sudden onset and termination of a fast heart rate``, as this is not a correct definition.`'.

Respond with two numbers ONLY on two lines. First, respond 1 (toxic) or 0 (not toxic) based on your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.
Second, respond 0 to implement your prediction of the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision, or 1 to delegate to the crowd-workers so they can implement their true aggregate decision.
A decision is considered correct if it equals the crowd-workers' true aggregate decision.
