 Storm, I saw your note on Trodel's page and wanted to touch base.  I am definately against merging, primarily because placing the topic in History of the Latter Day Saint movement reduces it to a ``one time`` issue.  The most recent pattern of ``faith-promoting`` history was (as a BYU trained historian, I sincerely hope) a one time event.  But Mormonism and history is a much bigger topic, closer to historiography, having implications from Joseph's time to the present.  I don't know if this is the right title for such an article, but we are having a restructuring discussion on the Mormonism and history page.  Please drop in and give your two cents.

 Let me respond again. 
  
 I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar.  
  
 I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how.  
  
 Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation.  
  
 If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'.  
  
 If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things.  
  
 Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil.  
  
 There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.

 Now, I'm not an ``authority`` such as people here claim to be. I don't hold any PhDs, nor do I feel I posses a ``body of knowledge`` that ``is very likely to dismiss...innocent guesses, or fractal knowledge.``  I have, however, spent some time in Russia and in Kazakhstan, specifically Almaty. That is the name I always hear people use - Almaty. The Russians, however, still call it Alma-Ata. For example, I was living in Nizhny Novgorod for awhile, and no one there knew what I was talking about when I said Almaty. All the people I met in Almaty, however, say Almaty. When I see the name written on signs and billboards in the city, it is also written as ``Алматы`` (Almaty).  
  
 From my experience, only the Russians continue the use of Alma-Ata. As another example, the train station in Moscow says Алма-Ата (Alma-Ata). However, it also says Gorki instead of Nizhny Novgorod (most everyone there says Nizhny Novgorod, or ``Nizhny`` for short - I can't recall actually hearing ``Gorki`` used beyond the train station). 
  
 Also, It's not just the Kazakh government who uses that name - it's a lot of people. Many books about the region published nowadays also use Almaty (they sometimes mention ``the Soviet Alma-Ata``, much like Bishkek is the ``Soviet Frunze``.  
  
 As for using the scientific/scholarly-approved approach for naming, Wikipedia doesn't do that (as mentioned above). See, the ``scientific`` or ``academic`` method for writing the offical name of the country - Қазақстан - is actually Qazaqstan (the letter Қ being offically transliterated as Q in English). There area few academic books do that (look at works from Indiana University, for example), but outside of these small circles, people by and large write Kazakhstan with a ``K``  - including Wikipedia. If people say we should use ``Alma-Ata`` because it's the correct name as dictated by academics, why no Qazaqstan?   
  
 Anyway, my point is that I found it surprising there are two different articles (Almaty and Alma-Ata). I think there should only be one, since regardless of the name it is still the same place. All the pictures and information should be seen together, on one page. They should be merged.  
  
 Oh, one more thing. I just went to Google and looked up ``Алматы`` (Almaty) - 4,270,000 hits. I then looked up ``Алма–Ата`` (Alma-Ata) - only 1,160,000.`'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,0.0,448,"[PROMPT]

 WilliamJE, I wanted to let you know why I've modified some of your edits. While you're to be commended for trying to pare down Notable people lists, the usual procedure for dealing with unsourced material is to tag it first.

 ==  's vandalism/lies/distortion of facts/mis-use of lack of communication between wiki administrators/WP:POV pushing == 
  
 I am putting it here, kindly read the whole story alongwith the proofs. 
  
 It appears that Admin  has ended up doing some big injustice without checking the facts. Per he has blocked anon  simply because he was trying to protect Wikipedia. Please correct this error otherwise this injustice and blocking comments are going to harm both innocent editors (  and   ) and their zeal to work on wikipedia and their future contributions/history as well. 
  
 Why 's Block was unjustified 
  
 ’s edits do not constitute vandalism 
  
 He simply restored duly referenced text.  
 * Proof 1 
 * Proof 2 
 * Proof 3 
  
   did not violate WP:3rr  
  
 He did not violate WP:3RR and he simply quit editing. 
  
   can not be a called a sockpuppet 
  
 * It was mentioned that  is licensed to Concord, CA and  is licensed to Los Angeles. Both of these cities are 6-7 hours of drive from each other? And it usually takes 1.5 hours of flight time if you want to fly from one city to another.  
 *  never participated in the edit war but instead he simply warned and warned reporting editor  against violation of Wikipedia policies. Is simple warning constitute sockpuppetry? 
 *If  had owned 2nd IP 209.183.55.115 as well, then he could have participated in the edit war through 2nd IP while staying within WP:3RR. It means he was not related to the 2nd IP at all. 
  
 Why ’s edits constitute violation of Wikipedia policies 
  
 Editor  repeatedly deleted duly referenced tex 
  
 *Edit 1  
 *edit 2  
 *Edit 3  
  
 Editor  repeatedly lied 
  
  lied/mislead Wikipedia community through his edit summaries and statements. 
 *Edit 1 – edit summary “Google Books isn't a very reliable source. Find a better source than that..” 
 *edit 2 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer” 
 *Edit 3 – edit summary “Reverted 1 edit by 32.177.111.155 identified as vandalism to last revision by Neutralhomer” 
 *again lied that city of Concord and city of Los Angeles are next to each other to get the opposing editors blocked under sock category. 
  
 Editor  repeatedly violated WP:POV  
  
  ruthlessly suppressed others voice and kept on removing the referenced text by blatantly refusing to accept the wp:rs reliability of various internationally known newspapers and a very notable google book which is already part of wikipedia, i.e. Reduced to Ashes (book).  refused to accept following references only because he could not like them:

 This passage seems to suggest the Samaritan was the neighbor while the other two were not.

It was you that made the issue of Ethnologue being a RS a big affair (as scripta manent - even in WP - all a reader has is to go up a few comments and see arrogant statements such as ``Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source.`` when there was no census in 1986 to begin with! The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become ``specialists`` when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's ``estimate`` is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his ``map``). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government ``convince`` people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit). Or that the results of such a private 1986 census would not become public until 2005! Maybe the evil Greek nationalists had a hand in that as well.

It was you that made the issue of Ethnologue being a RS a big affair (as scripta manent - even in WP - all a reader has is to go up a few comments and see arrogant statements such as ``Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source.`` when there was no census in 1986 to begin with! The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become ``specialists`` when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's ``estimate`` is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his ``map``). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government ``convince`` people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit). Or that the results of such a private 1986 census would not become public until 2005! Maybe the evil Greek nationalists had a hand in that as well. God spare us from the all-powerful WP ``specialists``.
