 Dear DF67, 
  
 Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. I promise to become less ``cute,`` and write with greater focus and brevity... next time. 
  
 One of the issues that I am sure is being addressed somewhere is that the people who should be editing The Neversink Gorge page and developing the Forestburgh page are so old that they can hardly deal with email. When I begged several of these people (who hate each other) who have vital collections of one of a kind books, documents, photos, articles, etc to look at what I had written and to edit it, they ``saw/experienced`` a ``googleesque`` one way portal; then, the one man who had the courage to click edit looked, blinked, read, stopped, called me and said, ``You claim it's so easy a dog could do it. If it's so easy then have Remsen edit it.`` He hung up. 
  
 This is not an ``issue`` that can be fixed anytime soon; however, Remsen will keep working on it. 
  
 As for my ``serious`` issue, I just got a nice note from Wesley Northrop resolving it: 
  
 Dear Mr Bertine, 
 Hm, I could have sworn I'd answered you the other day. If this is a duplicate 
 message, please ignore it. 
 As far as I can tell, the account ``Petebertine`` has not been banned at all; 
 the block log is totally empty. Perhaps you have been misspelling your 
 password? 
 If you have included your e-mail address in your account, you can have a 
 password reminder sent to you. If not, well... I suppose you could start a 
 fresh account (``PeteBertine2`` or something, for instance). 
 Yours sincerely, 
 Wesley Northrop 
  
 Pete Bertine and Remsen are impressed and thrilled with this experience, gold stars to everyone. We are now more determined than ever to get an 89 year old curmudgeon to contribute to Wikipedia. 
  
 My question: can you please direct me to the best, most successful example on Wikipedia of a town, like Forestburgh, representing itself in the ``wiki-community;`` and could you provide at least 2 ``wiki-person-users`` that I should attempt to emulate in my quest to create a ``wiki-forestburgh`` full of ``wiki-correct`` content. 
  
 Sincerely,

 == Ragusa- Dubrovnik- has never been in Italy!== 
 This article's statement in the part of ``Maratime Republics`` claiming that Ragusa was in Italy and therefore implying that it was an Italian republic is clearly a mistake. 
 One just needs to go into the Sponza palace, the Ragusian state archive in Dubrovnik and see any of the official documents. The laws regarding inner policy are clearly stated in Croatian: Those regarding foreign policy are written both in Croatian and Italian. All of the ruling families of Ragusa from Sorkocevic to Gucetic to Restic etc were Croatian. The greatest Ragusian poet and writer Ivan Gundulic, an aristocrat and one of the rulers, famous for his book ``Suze sina razmetnoga``, was one of the greatest Croatian nationalists.  Source: ``Dubrovnik, a history``, written by Robin Harris 2006. 
 According to the Robert Harris book Malta was independent until 1808 when Napoleon annexed it. According to Harris Dubrovnik with it's fleet of 700.000 tons (surpassing Venice in 1660) was the main hated rival of Venice in the Adriatic and always resisted the invasion plans of Venice. The last Venitian rector was sent home packing- politely but firmly- in 1351. According to Harris the recto packed his belongings in a hurry. 
  
 Some reflections  on this issue are necessary 
  
 First, it is necessary a reflection on the very concepts of Nation and State as these two terms are commonly considered near-synonyms and therefore used interchangeably. They have, instead different meanings. The term Italy refers to booth meanings. Italy as State was born in XIX cent, but Italy as Natiom is much older. Almost true, Ragusa never belonged to Italy-State except the Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy (1808-1809), but was seen for some centuries a part of Italy-Nation in the beginning of its birth process. Today Ragusa/Dubrovink, as well as Split and other Dalmatian towns, are out of Italy-State and out of Italy-Nation as well, they belong both to Croatia-Nation and to Croatia-State. On the other hand Lugano (Switzerland) and San Marino (independent republic) are out of Italy-State and still part of Italy-Nation. I suggest the book: L. TOMAZ, ``Il confine d'Italia in Istria e Dalmazia. Duemila anni di storia`` and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.   
  
 ==Romanians in 2007/2008== 
  
 I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.   
 :If you can give a reliable source that says this, go ahead and add it (including a reference to the source). However merely ``thinking`` that it's true is not a reliable source.   |

Duemila anni di storia`` and the SSRN working paper: ARNALDO MAURI, Historical, Geopolitical and Economic Factors affecting State and Nation Boundaries: Foreword on Italy's Borders in Istria and Dalmatia.,  Of course, Ragusa as port city had a multiethnic population: besides Italians also Croats, Vlachs, Serbs, Albanians. Similar situations could be found in Istanbul, Alexandria, Izmir, Odessa. To be the birthplace of poets or outstanding men is insignificant. Tommaseo was born in Dalmatia, as many other great Italians, Garibaldi and Massena were born in Nice, the Greek poet Kavafis in Alexandria. Venice was rival of Ragusa, but was also rival of Genoa on the sea and of Milan on the mainland; also this point is insignificant to the discussion on Ragusa belonging to Italy-Nation in past centuries.   
  
 ==Romanians in 2007/2008== 
  
 I think now that Romanians are the largest minority in Italy, someone should add this fact from this year.

 ::::I see this as an important issue that requires extreme caution. [I’m speaking generally as I haven’t had the time to try to analyze Yoyohooyo’s  specific assertions.] Of course the Massei report is biased. It’s trying to justify the court’s (prosecution) point of view. Whether or not it is deliberately MIS-leading is something we cannot prove or disprove. But by definition, it IS “leading”, i.e. it leads the reader to follow the judge’s reasoning. If the judge’s reasoning is incorrect (deliberately or not) or based on false assumptions, then the report is misleading. That would seem to be the reason for the policy on primary sources and in this case we have to follow not only the general guidance on primary sources, but the stricter rule: WP:BLP/Misuse of primary sources: Do not use trial transcripts and other court records, or other public documents, to support assertions about a living person. That seems pretty cut-and-dried. Maybe the report can be used to confirm what the court concluded, but anything more than that (including details that the court believes to be ``facts`` in reaching its conclusion) would seem to be prohibited as they are ``assertions about a living person``.  Demanding other RS’s, which may not exist, as an alternative to the Massei report is not a valid argument for using a prohibited source. At the risk of climbing on a soapbox, I will add that’s the problem with this article. We want to provide accurate, reliably-sourced facts; but too few facts are indisputably known and I fear that many of the sources we might like to rely on have been less careful in their scrutiny of officially-provided ``facts`` (what the prosecution and court have allowed to be released) than we are trying to be here. If we remove all contentious material, the article would be shorter and contain few details. And maybe that would be a good thing.   `'.",cot,gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07,0,,192,"[PROMPT]

 Sorry about that, but I find many editors revert without warning the perp.  What leads to me leaving a message on another editor's revert is when we both do the same revert but the other editor hits return a second or two before I do.  Since I'm already on the History page, I look to see if a warning was added.  I generally try to wait a bit before Saving the warning, but, as I say, a lot of warnings would not be left if I just assumed reverting editors were going to leave one.

 I edited a page, and you changed it back.  My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.  The individuals name Krista Jacobson used to be Chris Brooks.  None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.   
  
 I understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History.

 I edited a page, and you changed it back.  My information came from a Ranking Member of American Jujitsu and a Ranking Member of Australia Martial Arts (Chris Parker).  It is confirmed information.  The individuals name Krista Jacobson used to be Chris Brooks.  None on my contacts who have contacts in Japan can find any of her Dojos in Japan.   
  
 I understand you are well versed in the subject matter or Martial Arts, so am I. I am also well versed in History of Warrior Societies.  She is claiming things that do not link up with History. 
  
 Is there a better way that it should have been edited on my part?  
  
 Berzerker'.

 *Hi GotR. I would like to see you edit here again, as you have been doing a great job on subdivisions of China (although I believe you are exaggerating your irreplaceability: just because nobody hasn't picked up the job yet, it does not mean nobody will, and there is no WP:DEADLINE), but there are a couple of things you should think about before you are unblocked. One is that you should stop focusing on whether or not your indefblock was justified. What happened to you (blocks escalated after you didn't keep your cool while being blocked, but instead throwing red flags like new accounts in the face of all admins) isn't a case of you being singled out by an abusive admin, but actually fairly typical admin behaviour. At some point we tend to lose our patience and decide that a user is more trouble than they are worth (and the community expects us to make such decisions). You have a collection of accounts, all with block logs attached, that make it a bit wearying to even try to find out whether you were treated fairly at all times in the past. I think that you should stick to one account, strictly limit yourself to one revert, and you should not expect to find justice on Wikipedia for everything wrong that has happened to you. If others make a decision about you that you think is unfair and wrong, please first try to understand where they are coming from before you title your unblock request ``to right a great wrong``.

 The article was vandalized a few days ago and is now being returned to its original state. Any users wishing to dispute the information should do so here. If sysops examine the network log files, they will discover that the vast majority of referers come from 9/11 Truth sites, and the vast majority of exit links go to 9/11 Truth sites. Therefore, removing that information was damaging wikipedia's reputation. Visitors are depending on wikipedia to cover the work that Jones is currently involved in, which of course includes everything relating to 9/11 that was on that page. 
  
 Using the CT term to describe 9/11 theories is ad hominem and also not NPOV, and therefore not civil. Anyone endorsing that type of thinking is not NPOV and ask them to not edit the 9/11 pages. 
  
 As the Zogby poll shows, 42% of America believes the government is covering up 9/11 and 45% want a new investigation including government officials possibly being involved. 
  
 For now on, any vandalism or ad hominem remarks will be dealt with via official complaints using Wikipedia protocol. 
  
 Also, even though my ad hominem remarks were direct retaliation, I do apologize for them. Anyone using these types of remarks should not be editing these pages. I expect anyone and everyone to be civil.
